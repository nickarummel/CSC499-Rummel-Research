cities in the air to floating villages in the Bay of Tokyo, a group of forward-thinking Japanese architects, celebrated recently in the Pompidou&rsquo;s Japan-Ness exhibition in Metz, France, showed how creatively some of the country&rsquo;s finest architects approached &lsquo;sprawling urbanism&rsquo; in Japan after 1945.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p06fphl2\"}}</p><p>Architect Kenzo Tange kick-started the decade-long Metabolism movement, which incorporated innovative technologies and the use of modular units in architecture. He designed the 1960 Plan for Tokyo proposal, during a period of peak urban development in Japan. The project was designed to accommodate expansion in Tokyo by creating architecture that connected across the Tokyo Bay. It led to a new way of approaching urban design. Tange envisioned the use of a grand axis that would cross the bay and provide platforms for creatively designed buildings.</p><blockquote><p> The project promoted the concept of a floating metropolis in the ocean </p></blockquote><p>In 1966, Tange further developed his urban ideas when he designed the Yamanashi Broadcasting and Press Centre in Kofu. Created for three separate media companies, the building housed a newspaper printing plant, a radio station, and a television studio. To maximise space, Tange grouped similar functions of each office together, putting the newspaper printing machinery on the ground floor, the studios on the upper floors, and the office on glass-walled floors surrounded by balconies. Space was left within the structure to provide for future expansion, but it has now been used for gardens and terraces.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p06fpfgx\"}}</p><p>The 1958 Marine City project by visionary architect Kiyonori Kikutake was one of the first major ideas of the Metabolism movement, promoting the concept of a floating metropolis in the ocean. The structure would be self-sustainable, flexible, clean, earthquake-proof and flood resistant. It would also be located away from urban life on the mainland, using large steel rings with magnetic towers to hold its circular foundations in place. Ideally, the foundations would float on bottle-like forms, creating a rich aqua-culture farming industry. Kikutake&rsquo;s alternative living concept was radical at the time, but it was one of the first ideas to address issues of sustainability and modularity.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p06fpg3v\"}}</p><p>Another project that helped Japanese architects create a showcase for innovation in architecture was the Joint Core System (or City in the Air) which was developed in 1960 by Arata Isozaki. His plan included a multi-layered city with highways and parking structures woven between compounds of offices and apartments. In the original sketches, these structures look like trees, growing side by side. The branches function like passageways to living units, while the trunks act as large supports. This project is sometimes referred to as &lsquo;Clusters in the Air,&rsquo; as the trees develop and create a forest-like structure.</p><p><strong>The race for space</strong></p><p>Architect Kisho Kurokawa was a leader in the Metabolism movement in the 1960s, and his first Metabolic structure, Helix City, was prompted by a growing lack of space in Japan. The idea was to build a structure that functioned more efficiently and sensibly. Constructed with an organic design made up of a series of linked, helical structures, Helix City relies upon service towers that are connected by an infrastructure of bridges over both land and sea. Residential buildings fill in gaps in between the towers, creating a pattern that could hypothetically continue endlessly. This design was inspired by the 1953 discovery of DNA, a significant turning point for the study of life forms.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p06fph9z\"}}</p><p>Kurokawa&rsquo;s 1960 design for Agricultural City began after the architect survived the Ise Bay Typhoon in 1959. This project was created to prevent a habitat from being flooded by using a grid-like structure of concrete slabs, raised on stilts on agricultural soil, to synchronise the rural landscape with living areas. The grid provides for roads, water services, electricity, monorails, and structures like schools and administration buildings. Housing is designed in a mushroom shape &ndash; one to three floors, a wooden frame, and an aluminium cap. Though living units are separate, the linking together of these units creates a village. The entire grid would consist of enough space for about 200 people and a water system would be established beneath the complex.</p><blockquote><p> The architecture could grow and change as needed throughout the years </p></blockquote><p>From 1970 to 1972 Kurowaka and his team designed the Nakagin Capsule Tower in Ginza, Tokyo. This was the first-ever capsule-architecture design, created with the aim of housing businesspeople who would stay in the city during the week. The building represented a prototype for architecture that stressed sustainability and recyclability. Each of the 140 modules could be added to the central core or replaced and exchanged when necessary. This flexibility provided convenient methods of housing for the relatively brief stays of these visitors. Standing at 14 storeys high, the building was an initiative of the Metabolism movement to provide adaptable and interchangeable designs in cities.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p06fphx2\"}}</p><p>Also based on Metabolic principles was Kurokawa&rsquo;s 1966 project Resort Centre Yamagata Hawaii. The architect purposefully designed this building with the intention of creating no centre, so as to represent fluidity and motion. The Resort Centre Yamagata Hawaii Dreamland appealed to people who were beginning to travel postwar in Japan by instilling leisure and rest. The structure was very Metabolic, and its architecture could grow and change as needed to transform its shape throughout the years. The building was demolished around 1975, and residential towers were built in its place instead.</p><p>The ideas of architect Masato Otaka, meanwhile, did not gain as much international recognition as some of his colleagues&rsquo;, but his designs relied upon key elements of the Metabolism movement. From 1962, Otaka&rsquo;s housing development Sakaide Artificial Ground relied upon concrete building methods to create a new kind of urbanism in a social housing project on Shikoku Island. Otaka designed an artificial ground plane slightly above grade to allow buildings to interact more flexibly. This design took around 20 years to develop, overlapping with the fruition of the Urban Redevelopment Law in 1969.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p06fphdx\"}}</p><p>The Golgi Structure by architect Fumihiko Maki took its name from Nobel-Prize winner Camillo Golgi, a scientist who found a way to visualise nerve-cell bodies. Maki&rsquo;s structure combines dense urban area with unstructured open spaces to create an alternating effect. The open spaces in the structure are contained by light-absorbing cells that enable communication and energy distribution. This aspect of the project was key to Maki who stressed the idea of the collective form through three specific types: compositional, structural and sequential. The Golgi Structure contributed to this concept through the use of open spaces, providing mobility for residents and giving them an opportunity to interact with one another in a social environment.

may live in an age of lifts and escalators, but architects are still attracted to staircases that perform myriad functions. Today, a stairway can be a theatrical focal point, a feat of engineering or somewhere that encourages chance encounters and the exchange of ideas</p><p><strong>Upwards and onwards</strong></p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p05zs6nv\"}}</p><p>The protagonist of the Experimentarium science centre in Hellerup, a suburb of Copenhagen, is its so-called Helix staircase, fashioned from steel clad with 10 tons of copper. Protagonist is an apt word since its Danish architects CEBRA see the staircase in anthropomorphic terms: &ldquo;Previously an introverted building, the Experimentarium now appears as an extrovert, engaging, vibrant attraction,&rdquo; says Kolja Nielsen, a founding partner of CEBRA. &ldquo;It also ensures a better internal flow and creates more coherence between the floors.&rdquo;</p><p>The lustrous copper surface of this 100m-long, dramatically spiralling staircase is symbolic, too: &ldquo;It lets visitors know they&rsquo;ve entered a world of science,&rdquo; continues Nielsen. &ldquo;The stairs take the form of an abstract version of the DNA strand&rsquo;s structure, so the idea of the Helix staircase was born.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Line of beauty</strong></p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p05zs5w7\"}}</p><p>The eye-catching, brandy-coloured stairwell lined with oak fins at Victoria Gate shopping centre in Leeds, UK, is designed to contrast with the mall&rsquo;s predominantly white, sharply angular interior. The curvilinear staircase rises four floors to the roof, emerging at the juncture between an American and a Japanese restaurant. &ldquo;We wanted the staircase&rsquo;s rich, warm colour to speak about the night,&rdquo; says Friedrich Ludewig, of ACME architects, which designed it.</p><p>By day, the stairwell, which widens as it ascends the building and is crowned by a skylight, draws light into the shopping centre: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s shaped like an inverted pyramid to bring more light into the space,&rdquo; continues Ludewig. &ldquo;People feel like they&rsquo;re walking towards light as they climb up. At roof level, they have a view of the market nearby and of a beautiful landscape. We wanted the walk up the stairs to feel like a celebratory journey.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Form and function</strong></p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p05zs638\"}}</p><p>The arresting staircase at The Import Building, a co-working space for the creative and tech industries in East India Dock, London is conceptually complex. Designed by Studio RHE, it boasts a 10-storey atrium made of glulam (glued laminated timber). A top-heavy, asymmetric staircase, clad in powder-coated aluminium panels in a shrill, ultra-pop turquoise called Mexico Blue, devised by Porsche in the 1970s, cascades from the third to the ground floor.</p><p>&ldquo;Its form is derived from the angular journey the staircase makes as it intertwines with the timber grid,&rdquo; says Richard Hywel Evans, director of Studio RHE. &rdquo;We chose this blue &ndash;one of the most synthetic colours available &ndash; &nbsp;to create a striking contrast with the timber&rsquo;s neutral hues. The staircase is the main focus in the space, inviting visitors to climb stairs rather than take the lifts in a bid to create a healthy workplace. Generous landings as you venture upwards also encourage users to stop and take in views of the atrium and activity below.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Up, up and away</strong></p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p05zs5q4\"}}</p><p>In an unlikely, remote rural spot 85km north of Bangkok stands a wine bar constructed from plywood and steel cloaked in sheets of PVC that shields it from the rain. It&rsquo;s in Ayutthaya, a city razed to the ground in the 18th Century, which is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site. &ldquo;The building was constructed to become a new tourist attraction in the hope of stimulating the local economy,&rdquo; says Boonserm Premthada of Bangkok Project Studio, which designed it. Its translucent outer layer allows the building to blend with the surrounding landscape. Enhancing this experience inside, are five spiral staircases with platforms at different levels, which multiply the vistas of the greenery outside.</p><p>Each staircase incorporates a wide plywood strip that emphasises its corkscrewing motion and harmonises with the building&rsquo;s frame. While having a strong sculptural presence, the staircases perform a functional role too: they help to stabilise the columns that support the building.</p><p><strong>Lightness of being</strong></p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p05zs5lq\"}}</p><p>The stairs zigzagging up the Savile Row office of property company Derwent London &ndash; recently refurbished by architects Piercy &amp; Company &ndash;&nbsp;buck the trend for attention-grabbing staircases. Made of steel painted white, the large yet understated staircase is suspended from a new triple-height atrium, although its base makes contact with the lower floor. The ethereal-looking staircase almost disappears in the all-white interior of this 1930s Art Deco building, and seems to float in the space. &ldquo;The stairs&rsquo; visual lightness translates into physical lightness,&rdquo; says Stuart Piercy, director of Piercy &amp; Company. &ldquo;The entire structure is made of 0.5 cubic metres of steel.&rdquo;</p><p>The staircase is also subtly designed to encourage social interaction. At the top of each flight, its pale-oak handrail twists from a vertical to a horizontal plane, providing a ledge to lean on while people chat. In addition, by the staircase on each floor are designated spaces for socialising.</p><p><strong>Less is more</strong></p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p05zs6d0\"}}</p><p>Minimalism and old-world grandeur collide at Foster + Partners&rsquo; Apple store in Singapore. Its interior is lined with cream-coloured Italian Castagna stone that incorporates two sweeping staircases made of hand-carved stone. The architects describe these theatrical features as &ldquo;beautifully sculpted bookends&rdquo; that pay &ldquo;homage to craftsmanship&rdquo;. Paradoxically, even in the high-tech environs of an Apple store, traditional materials and aesthetics prevail.</p><p><strong>Step up</strong></p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p05zs745\"}}</p><p>A bombastic-looking Victorian staircase in a house in Stoke Newington, London, has been recently replaced with a thoroughly 21st-Century version. &ldquo;The old staircase was designed to be impressive,&rdquo; says Japanese architect Taro Tsuruta, who remodelled the house. &ldquo;It hogged space.&rdquo; Rising two storeys above the ground floor, the new staircase and landings are considerably slimmer. There were originally seven cramped bedrooms radiating from the stairs; now there are four roomier ones.</p><p>The staircase is made of 2,000 pieces of plywood cut by a computer-controlled cutting machine and assembled on site by carpenters. Slits between these pieces afford dramatic views up and down the stairwell.</p><p>Email messages between the architect and his clients &ndash; film-maker Ramon Bloomberg and his wife Marie Cesbron, who works in the beauty industry &ndash; are carved into the staircase. &lsquo;Can you remind me on what basis you will calculate your fee?&rsquo; reads one. &ldquo;We thought why not incorporate these conversations into the design,&rdquo; says Tsuruta. &rdquo;When a building is finished, they tend to be deleted. We wanted to keep those memories of the house&rsquo;s history and highlight the process behind redesigning it.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Colour pop</strong></p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p05zs67c\"}}</p><p>A yellow freestanding staircase &ndash; nicknamed the &lsquo;sunshine stair&rsquo; &ndash; is the standout feature of the compact, three-storey London home of portrait photographer Jonathan Root, called Pop-Up Ute. (The name refers to a lightweight, multipurpose truck popular in Australia.) The house, which won New London Architecture&rsquo;s Don&rsquo;t Move, Improve! Award for most innovative project this year, has been entirely redesigned by architects Friend and Company in the functionalist, high-tech style that first rose to prominence in the 1970s. Indeed, Friend and Company&rsquo;s director Adrian Friend is a fan of iconic high-tech building, The Centre Georges Pompidou, in Paris.</p><p>The staircase, which connects all floors and has rubber treads, descends through the house like a beam of sunlight. &ldquo;The staircase is painted zinc chromate yellow &ndash; a favourite of ours &ndash; which is used as a protective coating in the aerospace industry,&rdquo; says Friend. &ldquo;The staircase acts as a light transmitter: it reflects sunlight from the roof terrace and saves electricity by helping to illuminate the rooms below.&rdquo;</p><p><em>To comment on and see more stories from BBC Designed, you can follow us on&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCDesigned/\"><em><strong>Facebook</strong></em></a><em>,&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBC_designed\"><em><strong>Twitter</strong></em></a><em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/BBC_designed/\"><em><strong>Instagram</strong></em></a><em>.</em></p>","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":null,"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2018-03-05T10:00:00Z","Geolocation":null,"HeadlineLong":"The best contemporary staircases","HeadlineShort":"The best contemporary staircases","HideRelated":false,"Horizontal":null,"HyperHorizontal":null,"Intro":"Spiral, floaty, curvy or extrovert – the stunning stairways taking design to the next level.","IsSyndicated":true,"Latitude":"","Location":null,"Longitude":"","Option":null,"Partner":null,"PrimaryVertical":"wwculture","Programme":null,"RelatedStory":[{"Content":{"AssetCustom":"","AssetIbroadcast":null,"AssetImage":[],"AssetImagePromo":[],"AssetInfographic":"","AssetInline":[],"AssetSelect":"","AssetVideoIb2":null,"AssetVideoMps":null,"Author":[],"BodyHtml":"<p>The 20th Century witnessed radical experimentation in theatre design. Such eminent theatre directors as Tyrone Guthrie and Zelda Fichlander, for example, rejected the simplistic picture-frame stage, taking inspiration instead from the in-the-round and thrust stages &ndash; the latter projecting, jetty-like, into the auditorium &ndash; of ancient Greece and Rome.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p05vq7zz\"}}</p><p>In the 1970s, director Peter Brook tore up the rulebook further, producing plays in African villages, quarries and the formerly run-down but atmospheric Th&eacute;&acirc;tre des Bouffes du Nord in Paris, which he took over for several decades from 1974 with French producer Micheline Rozan.</p><p>But the 1960s and 1970s also saw the rise of the ultra-minimalist black-box theatre painted entirely in black whose supposedly neutral setting was regarded as easily adaptable to different productions. Stark and pared-down, it seemed to signify intellectual rigour, while its neutrality symbolised the idea of theatre as universally appealing.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p05vq88b\"}}</p><p>It might have been considered uncompromisingly avant-garde at the time, but today many cutting-edge architects and theatre consultancies see it as reductive, hackneyed and bland. The black-box backlash is giving rise to a new generation of theatres with an eclectic, even maximalist aesthetic.</p><p>Following in Brook&rsquo;s footsteps, many theatres have opened in characterful old buildings, says Gavin Green, co-founder of theatre and acoustics consultancy Charcoalblue, which has collaborated with the architects of such venues as St Ann&rsquo;s Warehouse and The Ronald O Perelman Performing Arts Center in New York, Storyhouse in Chester and the Young Vic in London. The last of these, refurbished in 2004 in conjunction with Howarth Tompkins Architects, is widely seen as a seminal example of a theatre remodelled to increase flexibility (a third performance space was added to it).</p><blockquote><p> &nbsp; There&rsquo;s a reaction against the black box&rsquo;s neutrality, which I see as analogous to the white-cube gallery in the art world &ndash; Jeff Day </p></blockquote><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a reaction against the black box&rsquo;s neutrality, which I see as analogous to the white-cube gallery in the art world,&rdquo; says Jeff Day, a founding principal of US architecture firm Min | Day, which redesigned the Bluebarn Theatre in Omaha, Nebraska. &ldquo;In the theatre world, reasons for the waning interest in it include its ubiquity, with audiences tiring of its austerity, and directors no longer feeling the need for pure neutrality. Another reason, perhaps, is a postmodern rejection of modern theatre as an abstract space divorced from its social context. As designers, we&rsquo;re motivated by a desire for warmth and a welcoming atmosphere.&rdquo;</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p05vq1yh\"}}</p><p>At Bluebarn, Min | Day deployed a rich palette of materials: its fa&ccedil;ade is clad in Cor-Ten steel that rusts when exposed to the elements, while its interior has walls and floors in salvaged wood, cobalt-blue ceilings, and reclaimed, burnt-orange velvet auditorium seating.</p><p>Another major trend is for theatres that acknowledge their context. A theatre at Horris Hill Preparatory School in Berkshire, created by Jonathan Tuckey Design and scheduled for completion later this year, has a roof clad in terracotta cement boards that tone with the surrounding brick buildings. Its interior is lined with pale, cross-laminated spruce. &ldquo;We wanted it to be the antithesis of a bland black-box space,&rdquo; says founder Jonathan Tuckey. At the rear of the auditorium is an amphitheatre, while a nearby courtyard caters to outdoor performances.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p05vq7lz\"}}</p><p>A further development, says Green, is for &ldquo;theatres in old buildings or for purpose-built ones to have the atmosphere and texture of found spaces.&rdquo; St Ann&rsquo;s Warehouse by Marvel Architects, for example, occupies a renovated 1860s tobacco warehouse, that makes a virtue of its industrial yet weathered materials &ndash; bricks, steel and plywood. Meanwhile, the intimate 100-seat Yard Theatre in east London is situated in a disused warehouse with an auditorium fashioned from reclaimed scaffolding boards and chairs from a defunct restaurant.</p><p><strong>Flexible friend</strong></p><p>Storyhouse, part of a regeneration scheme in Chester, occupies a new extension to a Grade II-listed 1930s Odeon cinema, which closed down in 2007. Remodelled by Bennetts Associates, the main building now includes a new library and cinema. Its original bold, cream Art Deco plasterwork can be seen from the scarlet passage linking the theatre to the adjoining building.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p05vq778\"}}</p><p>Storyhouse embodies another development, too: the relatively static black-box concept is being replaced by multidisciplinary arts centres that require flexible spaces for use by all genres of performance. Many of these boast theatres that can be subdivided into smaller ones or whose seating and staging can be thoroughly reconfigured. Storyhouse has an 800-seat proscenium that can be converted into a 500-seat thrust stage. &ldquo;Directors and designers now are interested in far more flexibility and adaptability, in being able to radically reconfigure an auditorium,&rdquo; says Green.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p05vq60h\"}}</p><p>The Shed in New York, designed by Diller Scofidio + Renfro in collaboration with Rockwell Group, which opens next year, is not so much flexible as veritably kinetic &mdash;&nbsp;it is encased by a telescoping structure that doubles the building&rsquo;s footprint and augments its performing space; it seats 1,200 people. Inspired by the industrial history of the nearby High Line and West Side Railyard, its mobile component glides along tracks on wheels, like those on railway carriages. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p> The flamboyant exteriors of many of today&rsquo;s theatres highlight the fact that they contain performance spaces </p></blockquote><p>Architecturally, theatres today often bridge their indoor and outdoor spaces in a bid to be more accessible and democratic. This chimes fortuitously with the fact that theatres are becoming more popular because, reasons Green, &ldquo;they bring people together. Younger people especially crave more lived, shared experiences in our age of social media.&rdquo;</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p05vq0yr\"}}</p><p>In Shanghai, the multi-purpose Fosun Foundation arts centre, designed by Heatherwick Studio in collaboration with Foster + Partners, embodies many current trends in theatre design: it combines a performance venue and galleries and boasts an opulent, semi-transparent fa&ccedil;ade that knits together the building and its environs. Its theatrical curtain-like fa&ccedil;ade drips with three layers of bronze-coloured, tassel-shaped tubes, which, inspired by Chinese weaving, nod to local tradition. Described by the architects as a &lsquo;veil,&rsquo; its layers move along tracks independently, separating to reveal a stage visible to passers-by or overlapping to form an opaque, organ-like wall.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p05vqlhh\"}}</p><p>Theatre Peckham in London, which adjoins a mixed-use arts centre in the redeveloped Southwark Town Hall,&nbsp;is a new-build with a flamboyant fa&ccedil;ade covered with iridescent porcelain tiles. &ldquo;The tiles reflect light which varies depending on weather conditions, creating an interesting, ever-changing fa&ccedil;ade,&rdquo; says Jude Harris, director of Jestico + Whiles, which designed it. And The Ronald O Perelman Performing Arts Center, created by Brooklyn practice REX on the site of the former World Trade Center, will be clad in veined, translucent marble which, illuminated at night, will be animated by flickering silhouettes of visitors and actors.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p05vq27s\"}}</p><p>The flamboyant exteriors of many of today&rsquo;s theatres highlight the fact that they contain performance spaces. As Harris puts it: &ldquo;the design of Theatre Peckham is a place of public performance, and the external appearance of our design aims to reflect this.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p><em>To comment on and see more stories from BBC Designed, you can follow us on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCDesigned/\"><strong>Facebook</strong></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBC_designed\"><strong>Twitter</strong></a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/BBC_designed/\"><strong>Instagram</strong></a>. </em></p>","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":null,"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2018-01-23T09:30:00Z","Geolocation":null,"HeadlineLong":"A brave new world of theatre design","HeadlineShort":"How theatres went from bland to bold","HideRelated":false,"Horizontal":null,"HyperHorizontal":null,"Intro":"A new generation of theatre buildings with an eclectic, characterful aesthetic is taking over from the neutral ‘black-box’ concept, says Dominic Lutyens.","IsSyndicated":true,"Latitude":"","Location":null,"Longitude":"","Option":null,"Partner":null,"PrimaryVertical":"wwculture","Programme":null,"RelatedStory":[],"RelatedTag":null,"StoryType":"image","SummaryLong":"A new generation of theatre buildings with an eclectic, characterful aesthetic is taking over from the neutral ‘black-box’ concept, says Dominic Lutyens.","SummaryShort":"The design of theatre buildings has changed radically in recent years","SuperSection":[],"Tag":null},"Metadata":{"CreationDateTime":"2018-01-23T10:11:15.47161Z","Entity":"story","Guid":"9027a82e-4b9e-49e5-99aa-a26d1f7a856d","Id":"wwculture/story/20180122-how-theatre-design-has-become-flamboyant-and-flexible","ModifiedDateTime":"2018-02-28T10:32:19.660404Z","Project":"wwculture","Slug":"20180122-how-theatre-design-has-become-flamboyant-and-flexible"},"Urn":"urn:pubstack:jative:story:wwculture/story/20180122-how-theatre-design-has-become-flamboyant-and-flexible","_id":"5b5f9d8c6d4f1eb9139e678f"},{"Content":{"AssetCustom":"","AssetIbroadcast":null,"AssetImage":[],"AssetImagePromo":[],"AssetInfographic":"","AssetInline":null,"AssetSelect":"ib2video","AssetVideoIb2":[],"AssetVideoMps":null,"Author":[],"BodyHtml":"<p>&ldquo;The beauty of Scotland is the effect of natural light,&rdquo; says Japanese architect Kengo Kuma, the visionary designer selected to create V&amp;A Dundee, the V&amp;A&rsquo;s first location outside London.</p><p>It was announced today that the museum, Scotland&rsquo;s first design museum, will open to the public on&nbsp;Saturday 15 September 2018.</p><p>&ldquo;Our museum is conceptually the bridge between nature and the city,&rdquo; Kuma says, explaining that he endeavours to be respectful of his \"neighbours\" &ndash; in this case the River Tay and RRS Discovery.</p><p>&ldquo;By using water, we tried to create a harmonious relationship between the ship, the museum and the River Tay&hellip; This is very complicated &ndash; three types of geometry &ndash; but finally we found a solution.

He designed the 1960 Plan for Tokyo proposal, during a period of peak urban development in Japan. The project was designed to accommodate expansion in Tokyo by creating architecture that connected across the Tokyo Bay. It led to a new way of approaching urban design. Tange envisioned the use of a grand axis that would cross the bay and provide platforms for creatively designed buildings.</p><blockquote><p> The project promoted the concept of a floating metropolis in the ocean </p></blockquote><p>In 1966, Tange further developed his urban ideas when he designed the Yamanashi Broadcasting and Press Centre in Kofu. Created for three separate media companies, the building housed a newspaper printing plant, a radio station, and a television studio. To maximise space, Tange grouped similar functions of each office together, putting the newspaper printing machinery on the ground floor, the studios on the upper floors, and the office on glass-walled floors surrounded by balconies. Space was left within the structure to provide for future expansion, but it has now been used for gardens and terraces.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p06fpfgx\"}}</p><p>The 1958 Marine City project by visionary architect Kiyonori Kikutake was one of the first major ideas of the Metabolism movement, promoting the concept of a floating metropolis in the ocean. The structure would be self-sustainable, flexible, clean, earthquake-proof and flood resistant. It would also be located away from urban life on the mainland, using large steel rings with magnetic towers to hold its circular foundations in place. Ideally, the foundations would float on bottle-like forms, creating a rich aqua-culture farming industry. Kikutake&rsquo;s alternative living concept was radical at the time, but it was one of the first ideas to address issues of sustainability and modularity.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p06fpg3v\"}}</p><p>Another project that helped Japanese architects create a showcase for innovation in architecture was the Joint Core System (or City in the Air) which was developed in 1960 by Arata Isozaki. His plan included a multi-layered city with highways and parking structures woven between compounds of offices and apartments. In the original sketches, these structures look like trees, growing side by side. The branches function like passageways to living units, while the trunks act as large supports. This project is sometimes referred to as &lsquo;Clusters in the Air,&rsquo; as the trees develop and create a forest-like structure.</p><p><strong>The race for space</strong></p><p>Architect Kisho Kurokawa was a leader in the Metabolism movement in the 1960s, and his first Metabolic structure, Helix City, was prompted by a growing lack of space in Japan. The idea was to build a structure that functioned more efficiently and sensibly. Constructed with an organic design made up of a series of linked, helical structures, Helix City relies upon service towers that are connected by an infrastructure of bridges over both land and sea. Residential buildings fill in gaps in between the towers, creating a pattern that could hypothetically continue endlessly. This design was inspired by the 1953 discovery of DNA, a significant turning point for the study of life forms.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p06fph9z\"}}</p><p>Kurokawa&rsquo;s 1960 design for Agricultural City began after the architect survived the Ise Bay Typhoon in 1959. This project was created to prevent a habitat from being flooded by using a grid-like structure of concrete slabs, raised on stilts on agricultural soil, to synchronise the rural landscape with living areas. The grid provides for roads, water services, electricity, monorails, and structures like schools and administration buildings. Housing is designed in a mushroom shape &ndash; one to three floors, a wooden frame, and an aluminium cap. Though living units are separate, the linking together of these units creates a village. The entire grid would consist of enough space for about 200 people and a water system would be established beneath the complex.</p><blockquote><p> The architecture could grow and change as needed throughout the years </p></blockquote><p>From 1970 to 1972 Kurowaka and his team designed the Nakagin Capsule Tower in Ginza, Tokyo. This was the first-ever capsule-architecture design, created with the aim of housing businesspeople who would stay in the city during the week. The building represented a prototype for architecture that stressed sustainability and recyclability. Each of the 140 modules could be added to the central core or replaced and exchanged when necessary. This flexibility provided convenient methods of housing for the relatively brief stays of these visitors. Standing at 14 storeys high, the building was an initiative of the Metabolism movement to provide adaptable and interchangeable designs in cities.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p06fphx2\"}}</p><p>Also based on Metabolic principles was Kurokawa&rsquo;s 1966 project Resort Centre Yamagata Hawaii. The architect purposefully designed this building with the intention of creating no centre, so as to represent fluidity and motion. The Resort Centre Yamagata Hawaii Dreamland appealed to people who were beginning to travel postwar in Japan by instilling leisure and rest. The structure was very Metabolic, and its architecture could grow and change as needed to transform its shape throughout the years. The building was demolished around 1975, and residential towers were built in its place instead.</p><p>The ideas of architect Masato Otaka, meanwhile, did not gain as much international recognition as some of his colleagues&rsquo;, but his designs relied upon key elements of the Metabolism movement. From 1962, Otaka&rsquo;s housing development Sakaide Artificial Ground relied upon concrete building methods to create a new kind of urbanism in a social housing project on Shikoku Island. Otaka designed an artificial ground plane slightly above grade to allow buildings to interact more flexibly. This design took around 20 years to develop, overlapping with the fruition of the Urban Redevelopment Law in 1969.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p06fphdx\"}}</p><p>The Golgi Structure by architect Fumihiko Maki took its name from Nobel-Prize winner Camillo Golgi, a scientist who found a way to visualise nerve-cell bodies. Maki&rsquo;s structure combines dense urban area with unstructured open spaces to create an alternating effect. The open spaces in the structure are contained by light-absorbing cells that enable communication and energy distribution. This aspect of the project was key to Maki who stressed the idea of the collective form through three specific types: compositional, structural and sequential. The Golgi Structure contributed to this concept through the use of open spaces, providing mobility for residents and giving them an opportunity to interact with one another in a social environment. It was a quintessentially Metabolic design.</p><p>&nbsp;<em>To comment on and see more stories from BBC Designed, you can follow us on&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCDesigned/\"><em><strong>Facebook</strong></em></a><em>,&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbc_designed?lang=en\"><em><strong>Twitter</strong></em></a><em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/bbc_designed/?hl=en\"><em><strong>Instagram</strong></em></a><em>.</em></p>","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":null,"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2018-07-25T17:25:46.961Z","Geolocation":null,"HeadlineLong":"How Japan’s visionaries saw the future","HeadlineShort":"How Japan’s visionaries saw the future","HideRelated":false,"Horizontal":null,"HyperHorizontal":null,"Intro":"Dreamland cities in the air, floating villages and forest-like structures were all envisioned by the forward-thinking ‘Metabolic’ architects of the past.

As a result, their design has been hardly documented. But challenging this preconception is a new exhibition, <a href=\"https://www.design-museum.de/en/exhibitions/current-exhibitions.html\">Night Fever: Designing Club Culture, 1960-Today</a>, at the Vitra Design Museum in Weil am Rhein in Germany, that takes a detailed look at the evolution of nightclub design worldwide.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p067x3xk\"}}</p><p>During the economic boom of the 1960s, club design entered a highly creative phase. An explosion of new, anything-goes venues with fantastical interiors offered the bohemian, fun-seeking &ndash; and often marginalised &shy;&ndash; a stimulating, tolerant environment where they could freely express themselves. For architects, the clubs&rsquo; raw interiors were a boon, providing them with a blank canvas.</p><p>&ldquo;Night Fever is the first large-scale show about the relationship between club culture and design, and encompasses interiors, sound and lighting technology, fashion and graphics,&rdquo; co-curator Catharine Rossi tells BBC Designed. &ldquo;The show is partly based on an exhibition I curated on Italian nightclubs created by architects of the Radical Design movement, which rebelled against modernism.&rdquo;</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p067xf51\"}}</p><p>The show starts with the invention of the modern club in the context of the 1960s counterculture, then on to club-related fashion and furniture. &ldquo;We wanted the show, designed by industrial designer Konstantin Grcic, to be multisensory and affective, and this section allows visitors to listen to different genres of music, and features light-and-sound installations,&rdquo;&nbsp;says Rossi.</p><p>The first European disco is said to have been Paris bo&icirc;te Whisky &agrave; Gogo, where, from the 1950s, owner R&eacute;gine operated two turntables to avoid breaks between tracks. A key reference point for nightclub designers in the 1960s was the (unbuilt) Fun Palace &ndash; &nbsp;a self-proclaimed &lsquo;laboratory of fun&rsquo;. Designed by Cedric Price in 1961 for theatre producer Joan Littlewood, it was a multipurpose, kinetic space featuring moving catwalks and inflatable structures.</p><blockquote><p> There was a cross-pollination between club design in Italy and New York </p></blockquote><p>Many of Italy&rsquo;s 1960s discos were also radically experimental, for example the Piper in Rome designed by Manilo Cavalli and Francesco and Giancarlo Capolei. &ldquo;In 1950s Rome, an emerging Pop art movement was celebrating the ephemeral, with happenings and improvisation. We wanted to connect this to architecture,&rdquo; says Francesco Capolei. &ldquo;At the Piper in Rome we broke away from the classic nightclub layout with its stage, orchestra and dancefloor.&rdquo; Instead it had moveable platforms to suit different events. One wall displayed art by the likes of Piero Manzoni and Andy Warhol.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p067x586\"}}</p><p>In 1969, Radical Design collective Gruppo 9999 transformed an engine-repair shop into eccentric club Space Electronic that staged plays, housed an architecture school and grew vegetables on the dancefloor. Barbarella, designed by Studio65 and opened in 1972, featured a spaceship-themed DJ booth and bar and fragments of Ionic columns &ndash;&nbsp;an ironic nod perhaps to Italy&rsquo;s over-venerated classical past. Another club, Flash Back, opened in 1973, and boasted scarlet staircases evoking the drawings of Giovanni Piranesi.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p067x6jt\"}}</p><p>There was a cross-pollination between club design in Italy and New York. Two of Space Electronic&rsquo;s architects, Carlo Caldini and Mario Preti, visited avant-garde New York club Electric Circus, which, like many 1960s Manhattan nightspots, placed more emphasis on intangible, ambient elements &ndash; lighting, sound and drugs &ndash; than furniture. At Electric Circus, Warhol orchestrated his Exploding Plastic Inevitable events, featuring performances by The Velvet Underground, overlaid with psychedelic light projections. At John Storyk&rsquo;s club Cerebrum, punters changed into white gowns and lounged on white carpets munching marshmallows.</p><blockquote><p> Clubs like Studio 54 were theatrical spaces where everyone was on stage, everyone was a performer &ndash; Catharine Rossi </p></blockquote><p>Studio 54 &ndash; with its door policy filtering out all but hip celebrities, the beautiful or the super-stylish &ndash;&nbsp;ushered in a slicker approach to interior design. Co-founders Ian Schrager and Steve Rubell hired architect Scott Bromley, interior designer Ron Doud and Broadway lighting specialists Jules Fisher and Paul Marantz.</p><p><strong>Disco fever</strong></p><p>In this former theatre, lighting was king. Illuminating the all-important dance floor was a ceiling incorporating mirrored panels and pink neon. Advancing across the floor was a bridge with flashing lights that supported 250 revellers; the structure also scattered glitter and spewed dry ice.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p067xg7b\"}}</p><p>&ldquo;Clubs such as Studio 54, which opened in 1978, were theatrical spaces where everyone was on stage, everyone was a performer,&rdquo; says curator Rossi. In the mid-to-late 1970s, disco became a musical genre, but the exhibition also looks at the 1979 Disco Demolition Night rally in Chicago, where more than 60,000 &ndash; mainly male, white &ndash; disco-phobes smashed the dance records that had caused Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath to disappear from radio playlists.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p067x4bh\"}}</p><p>That movement had racist, homophobic undertones: disco music had its roots in New York&rsquo;s egalitarian, underground clubs, which circumvented such rules as men only being allowed to dance with women. In the 1970s, at clubs such as David Mancuso&rsquo;s The Loft and Paradise Garage &ndash; housed in a disused garage, with Larry Levan as its resident DJ &ndash; white, black and Latino people mingled.</p><p>By the late 1970s and early &rsquo;80s, many considered discos such as Studio 54 to be overly commercial and pass&eacute;, and the Big Apple witnessed the rise of edgier venues like the Mudd Club, among others, which espoused a punk-inspired, DIY sensibility. It invited artist Keith Haring to curate its fourth-floor art gallery, and Haring also created a mural for the Palladium.&nbsp;</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p067x8vb\"}}</p><p>Northern England had its post-punk big-club counterpart in Manchester&rsquo;s Ha&ccedil;ienda, designed by Ben Kelly. &ldquo;Its industrial aesthetic was inspired by the spirit of independent record label Factory Records,&rdquo; Kelly tells BBC Designed. &ldquo;Its aesthetic also sprang from safety considerations: I wrapped hazard tape around columns to make them easier to see, and set cat&rsquo;s eyes into the dance floor. I was interested in taking fittings that normally belong in one environment and putting them into another. You entered the club through clear plastic curtains like those you&rsquo;d see in an abattoir.&rdquo;</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p067xfm6\"}}</p><p>Of course, there&rsquo;s the danger of romanticising nightclubs as avant-garde and socially progressive. Take London&rsquo;s Ministry of Sound, which opened in 1991 and is now a corporate phenomenon with its own merchandising and music-publishing business.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p067xh4s\"}}</p><p>And the exhibition addresses the fact that the future of clubbing is uncertain, thanks to factors such as gentrification &ndash; which prioritises office buildings and homes over noisy nightclubs &ndash; young people drinking less alcohol and digital dating apps. One way clubs are surviving is by inhabiting multi-use spaces, partly as a way around skyrocketing rents. &ldquo;Printworks in London, which includes a club, is doing very well,&rdquo; points out Catharine Rossi. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think clubbing is over just yet.&rdquo;</p><p><em>Night Fever runs until 9 September.

Enhancing this experience inside, are five spiral staircases with platforms at different levels, which multiply the vistas of the greenery outside.</p><p>Each staircase incorporates a wide plywood strip that emphasises its corkscrewing motion and harmonises with the building&rsquo;s frame. While having a strong sculptural presence, the staircases perform a functional role too: they help to stabilise the columns that support the building.</p><p><strong>Lightness of being</strong></p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p05zs5lq\"}}</p><p>The stairs zigzagging up the Savile Row office of property company Derwent London &ndash; recently refurbished by architects Piercy &amp; Company &ndash;&nbsp;buck the trend for attention-grabbing staircases. Made of steel painted white, the large yet understated staircase is suspended from a new triple-height atrium, although its base makes contact with the lower floor. The ethereal-looking staircase almost disappears in the all-white interior of this 1930s Art Deco building, and seems to float in the space. &ldquo;The stairs&rsquo; visual lightness translates into physical lightness,&rdquo; says Stuart Piercy, director of Piercy &amp; Company. &ldquo;The entire structure is made of 0.5 cubic metres of steel.&rdquo;</p><p>The staircase is also subtly designed to encourage social interaction. At the top of each flight, its pale-oak handrail twists from a vertical to a horizontal plane, providing a ledge to lean on while people chat. In addition, by the staircase on each floor are designated spaces for socialising.</p><p><strong>Less is more</strong></p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p05zs6d0\"}}</p><p>Minimalism and old-world grandeur collide at Foster + Partners&rsquo; Apple store in Singapore. Its interior is lined with cream-coloured Italian Castagna stone that incorporates two sweeping staircases made of hand-carved stone. The architects describe these theatrical features as &ldquo;beautifully sculpted bookends&rdquo; that pay &ldquo;homage to craftsmanship&rdquo;. Paradoxically, even in the high-tech environs of an Apple store, traditional materials and aesthetics prevail.</p><p><strong>Step up</strong></p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p05zs745\"}}</p><p>A bombastic-looking Victorian staircase in a house in Stoke Newington, London, has been recently replaced with a thoroughly 21st-Century version. &ldquo;The old staircase was designed to be impressive,&rdquo; says Japanese architect Taro Tsuruta, who remodelled the house. &ldquo;It hogged space.&rdquo; Rising two storeys above the ground floor, the new staircase and landings are considerably slimmer. There were originally seven cramped bedrooms radiating from the stairs; now there are four roomier ones.</p><p>The staircase is made of 2,000 pieces of plywood cut by a computer-controlled cutting machine and assembled on site by carpenters. Slits between these pieces afford dramatic views up and down the stairwell.</p><p>Email messages between the architect and his clients &ndash; film-maker Ramon Bloomberg and his wife Marie Cesbron, who works in the beauty industry &ndash; are carved into the staircase. &lsquo;Can you remind me on what basis you will calculate your fee?&rsquo; reads one. &ldquo;We thought why not incorporate these conversations into the design,&rdquo; says Tsuruta. &rdquo;When a building is finished, they tend to be deleted. We wanted to keep those memories of the house&rsquo;s history and highlight the process behind redesigning it.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Colour pop</strong></p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p05zs67c\"}}</p><p>A yellow freestanding staircase &ndash; nicknamed the &lsquo;sunshine stair&rsquo; &ndash; is the standout feature of the compact, three-storey London home of portrait photographer Jonathan Root, called Pop-Up Ute. (The name refers to a lightweight, multipurpose truck popular in Australia.) The house, which won New London Architecture&rsquo;s Don&rsquo;t Move, Improve! Award for most innovative project this year, has been entirely redesigned by architects Friend and Company in the functionalist, high-tech style that first rose to prominence in the 1970s. Indeed, Friend and Company&rsquo;s director Adrian Friend is a fan of iconic high-tech building, The Centre Georges Pompidou, in Paris.</p><p>The staircase, which connects all floors and has rubber treads, descends through the house like a beam of sunlight. &ldquo;The staircase is painted zinc chromate yellow &ndash; a favourite of ours &ndash; which is used as a protective coating in the aerospace industry,&rdquo; says Friend. &ldquo;The staircase acts as a light transmitter: it reflects sunlight from the roof terrace and saves electricity by helping to illuminate the rooms below.&rdquo;</p><p><em>To comment on and see more stories from BBC Designed, you can follow us on&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCDesigned/\"><em><strong>Facebook</strong></em></a><em>,&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBC_designed\"><em><strong>Twitter</strong></em></a><em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/BBC_designed/\"><em><strong>Instagram</strong></em></a><em>.</em></p>","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":null,"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2018-03-05T10:00:00Z","Geolocation":null,"HeadlineLong":"The best contemporary staircases","HeadlineShort":"The best contemporary staircases","HideRelated":false,"Horizontal":null,"HyperHorizontal":null,"Intro":"Spiral, floaty, curvy or extrovert – the stunning stairways taking design to the next level.","IsSyndicated":true,"Latitude":"","Location":null,"Longitude":"","Option":null,"Partner":null,"PrimaryVertical":"wwculture","Programme":null,"RelatedStory":[],"RelatedTag":[],"StoryType":"image","SummaryLong":"Spiral, floaty, curvy or extrovert – the stunning stairways taking design to the next level.","SummaryShort":"Spiral, floaty, curvy – the stunning stairways taking design to the next level","SuperSection":[],"Tag":null},"Metadata":{"CreationDateTime":"2018-03-05T11:56:50.054222Z","Entity":"story","Guid":"4eb3d21b-7404-4a72-aa19-31b7a7b050c5","Id":"wwculture/story/20180305-the-best-contemporary-staircases","ModifiedDateTime":"2018-03-05T13:29:04.786455Z","Project":"wwculture","Slug":"20180305-the-best-contemporary-staircases"},"Urn":"urn:pubstack:jative:story:wwculture/story/20180305-the-best-contemporary-staircases","_id":"5b5ff7106d4f1eb9139e96ed"},{"Content":{"AssetCustom":"","AssetIbroadcast":null,"AssetImage":[],"AssetImagePromo":[],"AssetInfographic":"","AssetInline":[],"AssetSelect":"","AssetVideoIb2":null,"AssetVideoMps":null,"Author":[],"BodyHtml":"<p>Dotted throughout Iceland&rsquo;s rocky, otherworldly terrain are structures that seem to have been formed from the earth by a numinous hand. These geometric, often asymmetrical buildings look like the dwellings of the &lsquo;hidden folk&rsquo; of Icelandic mythology, perhaps the last refuges of the ice giants Odin was unable to exterminate. But in fact, they are simply Icelandic interpretations of communal staples found in most cities and towns throughout the world: churches.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p06dfz9v\"}}</p><p>These buildings are examples of Iceland&rsquo;s unique take on modernist architecture. While modernist churches are certainly not unique to Iceland, its approach to the movement is singular in that it is deeply informed by its cultural history and landscape.</p><p>Icelandic Modernism was born of a 20th-Century push to create a distinctive architectural style after centuries of Norwegian &mdash;&nbsp;followed by Danish &mdash;&nbsp;rule. The brightly coloured timber houses that line the streets of Icelandic towns were often wholly imported from Norway, and 19th-Century stone houses were mostly designed by the Danish government. It was not until cement &mdash;&nbsp; a material that could endure the harsh climate and that did not have to be imported &mdash;&nbsp; was introduced, that a uniquely Icelandic style could be created.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p06dg667\"}}</p><p>Iceland&rsquo;s relatively late development of a national architectural style was also due to its harsh, sparsely-vegetated terrain. While mainland European nations had a wealth of resources to use for construction, Icelandic settlers were forced to get creative, leading to the development of the iconic turf house in the 9th Century, which remained the dominant form of housing until the early 20th Century.</p><p>Using timber only for a structural base, turf houses consisted primarily of layers of rock with compressed soil. An outer layer, made of turf cut into strips, diamonds or squares, was then pressed on top, creating the iconic look of Icelandic homes.</p><blockquote><p> Some could even be mistaken for Neolithic pagan shrines were if not for the prominent crosses </p></blockquote><p>Many modernist churches in Iceland are futuristic odes to this original architectural model. For example, the churches that celebrated Icelandic architect Ragnar Emilsson designed &mdash;&nbsp; Mosfellskirkja, St&oacute;ra Dalskirkja,and K&oacute;pavogskirkja &mdash;&nbsp; are all revisitations of the signature triangular structure of the turf house.</p><p>Seltjarnarneskirkja, designed by Har&eth;ar Bj&ouml;rnssonar and consecrated in 1989, follows a similar style, with the addition of multi-layered triangular rooftops.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p06dfzbg\"}}</p><p>But the undisputed leader of the Icelandic architectural revolution was Gu&eth;j&oacute;n Samuelsson who was commissioned to design new buildings in Reykjavik after a devastating fire in 1915 destroyed the majority of the Norwegian timber houses. Samuelsson wanted to contribute visually to the revival of the independent Icelandic Commonwealth, a movement that poetically was on the cusp of realisation at the time of the fire. When Denmark granted Iceland sovereignty in 1918, Samuelsson&rsquo;s unique vision was ready quite literally to rise from the ashes of foreign rule.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p06dfz70\"}}</p><p>Samuelsson drew inspiration from early European Modernism and Iceland&rsquo;s breathtaking landscape. Not only did his buildings take on the shape of Icelandic natural monuments, but often were infused with local types of rock like obsidian, quartz and Icelandic spar.</p><p><strong>Natural modernism</strong></p><p>Iceland&rsquo;s largest building, Hallgrimskirkja, is a church designed by Samuelsson and is a testament to his style. Commissioned in 1937 and consecrated in 1986, Hallgrimskirja&rsquo;s imposing shape was designed to resemble Icelandic trap rocks, mountains, and glaciers.</p><p>Many Icelandic churches follow Samuelsson&rsquo;s naturalistic approach to Modernism. For example, Stykkish&oacute;lmskirkja, designed by Jon Haraldsson and consecrated in 1990, consists of dramatic curved white slopes and jagged edges reminiscent of a glacier. In the winter months, when the surrounding landscape is covered in snow, Stykkish&oacute;lmskirkja appears to grow seamlessly from the frozen ground.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p06dfz3m\"}}</p><p>In profile, the jagged rooftop and skeletal spire of H&aacute;kon Hertervig&rsquo;s &Oacute;lafsv&iacute;kurkirkja, look like&nbsp; the mountains that loom on the Icelandic horizon.</p><blockquote><p> They seem to erupt from the rocky earth, their concrete structures taking on the appearance of once-sacred natural formations </p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Bl&ouml;ndu&oacute;skirkja, the brainchild of Dr Maggi J&oacute;nsson, is a Brutalist take on the volcanoes scattered throughout the country. Consecrated in 1993, its stark obsidian black frame is nearly as ominous as the volatile natural formations it was inspired by.</p><p>Churches that follow Samuelsson&rsquo;s model of natural Modernism are emblematic of the country&rsquo;s animistic history, standing more as monuments to nature than Christ. They seem to erupt from the rocky earth, their concrete structures taking on the appearance of once-sacred natural formations. Some could even be mistaken for Neolithic pagan shrines were if not for the prominent crosses.</p><p>Iceland&rsquo;s relationship with Christianity is ancient and complex. In fact, the first people to inhabit the island were Irish monks who came for six months to live as hermits in around 795 AD. When Scandinavian settlers arrived in the mid-9th Century, Norse paganism then became the dominant religion. After several attempts by the King of Norway to convert Iceland, Christianity was peacefully adopted as the state religion in 1000 AD. Some scholars believe that Althingi&rsquo;s (or Iceland&rsquo;s quasi-parliamentary medieval government) were motivated by political and economic reasons to convert, rather than actual religious fervour.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p06dfz36\"}}</p><p>Unlike in European countries where Pagan conversion was born of bloody subjugation, Iceland&rsquo;s relatively peaceful Christianisation allowed for its Norse roots to remain a part of the country&rsquo;s cultural identity. Whereas most newly-converted countries quickly adopted a staunch anti-Pagan stance, Icelandic Christianity built upon its Pagan roots, weaving a deep affection for the old ways into the new. This process of combining sacred with sacred can be seen in the figure of Thorlakur Thorahallsson, who in spite of having a first and surname that directly referenced the Norse god Thor, went on to become the patron saint of Iceland.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p06dfz3h\"}}</p><p>Contemporary church attendance in Iceland is very low, with only 10 per cent of the population reporting that they go to church once a month or more and 50 per cent saying they never go at all. Paganism however, has enjoyed a recent 50 per cent spike in adherents in 2017 alone. With such low attendance numbers, one must question what purpose these modernist churches serve for the Icelandic people. Given their obvious nods to the country&rsquo;s landscape and its architectural and religious past, these paragons of modern design seem like odes to Iceland&rsquo;s ancient history, and a promise to remember it in the future.</p><p><em>If you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Culture, head over to our&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/BBC-Culture/237388053065908\"><em><strong>Facebook</strong></em></a><em>&nbsp;page or message us on</em>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbc_culture\"><em><strong>Twitter</strong></em></a><em>.</em></p><p><em>And if you liked this story,&nbsp;</em><a href=\"http://pages.emails.bbc.com/subscribe/\"><strong>sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter</strong></a><em>, called &ldquo;If You Only Read 6 Things This Week&rdquo;.

References to milestones along the path towards greater global LGBTQ freedom sit alongside very focused local history &ndash; according to the show, around 10 to 15 per cent of Brighton&rsquo;s population identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans and queer.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p06crww5\"}}</p><p>Queer Looks brings together about 20 outfits given to the museum by LGBTQ individuals who live or have lived in the Brighton area, alongside oral histories of their experiences. It is the second chapter of a project called <a href=\"http://www.arts.ac.uk/research/current-research/ual-research-projects/curation--culture/wear-it-out-the-culture-and-heritage-of-lgbt-dress-in-sussex-1917-2017/\">Wear it Out</a>, a collaboration with Brighton&rsquo;s museums and the London College of Fashion. &ldquo;Its timeframe is 1917 to 2017,&rdquo; says curator Martin Pel, yet the exhibition is open-ended, treating social history as living. &ldquo;The museum&rsquo;s website has a <a href=\"http://queer-looks.brightonmuseums.org/\">micro-site</a> where people can add new stories,&rdquo; Pel explains.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p> Ah, dear Brighton &ndash; piers, queers and racketeers &ndash; No&euml;l Coward </p></blockquote><p>&ldquo;The show marks the 50th anniversary of the partial decriminalisation of homosexuality in 1967 [in England and Wales],&rdquo; he continues. &ldquo;Brighton Museum is the perfect venue for it: people have gravitated to Brighton as it&rsquo;s tolerant.&rdquo; In fact, the gay community already had a strong presence there in the early 20th Century, if playwright and composer No&euml;l Coward&rsquo;s quip is to be believed: &ldquo;Ah, dear Brighton &ndash; piers, queers and racketeers.&rdquo;</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p06crwx6\"}}</p><p>The first part of Wear it Out comprised an exhibition about defiantly androgynous, openly lesbian artist Hannah Gluckstein (1895-1978). While her art was arguably academic and stiff in style, its subject matter was challenging. In a self-portrait of 1925, as if pre-figuring the look of such Spanish Civil War communist sympathisers as Stephen Spender, she sported a rakishly angled beret and tie, a cigarette drooping from her mouth. Decades later, sexually ambiguous model and disco diva Grace Jones echoed this pose &ndash; cigarette dangling from her lips &ndash; on the cover of her 1981 album, Nightclubbing.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p06cs1p1\"}}</p><p>Gluckstein also adopted the clipped name Gluck &ndash; without &ldquo;prefixes, suffixes and quotes&rdquo; &ndash; thereby demonstrating her impatience for glib gender stereotyping. And she had relationships with florist Constance Spry and journalist Edith Shackleton Heald, with whom she lived for 30 years in Steyning, near Brighton. She donated a number of her girlfriends&rsquo; dresses to the museum.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p06crwrc\"}}</p><p>Queer Looks argues that clothing has played &ndash; and still plays &ndash; a key role in shaping personal identities beyond conventional gender roles as well as, more collectively, those of subcultures who often adopt specific styles of clothing as an expression of solidarity. The growing number of officially acknowledged LGBTQ identities, from trans and non-binary to QTIPOC (queer, trans and intersex people of colour), has given rise to a much bigger variety of sartorial styles.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p06cry43\"}}</p><p>The exhibition comprises vignettes that dovetail outfits, portraits of their owners and biographical snippets. It also touches upon 18th-Century LGBTQ-related language and its etymology, for example, the word homosexuality, said to have been coined in 1869 by Austrian-born human-rights campaigner Karl-Maria Kertbeny.</p><p><strong>Radical chic</strong></p><p>Some individuals participating in the show have been instrumental in steering fashion in a radically new direction. James Gardiner was part of the first influx of London College of Fashion students in the early 1960s, and dressed movie star Elizabeth Taylor for her 40th birthday. In order to help finance his college days, he sold ties to Vince&rsquo;s Man&rsquo;s Shop in London&rsquo;s Soho, a store that helped to revolutionise menswear in the 1960s.&ldquo;His outfit is a suit worn with brothel creepers,&rdquo; says Pel. &ldquo;Shop-owner Vince stocked tight-fitting, Italian men&rsquo;s threads &ndash; including shorter jackets called bum freezers &ndash; that appealed to gay men who wanted to show off their bodies, and inspired the broader Mod look.&rdquo;</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p06crwqq\"}}</p><p>David Raven, aka drag artist Maisie Trollette, is represented by a paisley jacket, Cartier shirt and cotton trousers from 1985. He first began performing in the 1960s while working as a grocer at Selfridges in London (he is now based in Brighton) but kept his alter ego under wraps: &ldquo;I was recognised once by a man who said to me &lsquo;Didn&rsquo;t I see you doing cabaret last night?&rsquo; I told him he must be mistaken because I was a grocer.&rdquo;</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p06ctz1n\"}}</p><p>By contrast, for many gay men from the 1970s to the present day, clothing has taken the form of overtly sexual fetish gear, such as the chaps, shorts or harnesses worn by Michael James, born in 1941, and Jason Snelling (born in 1970) at gay clubs with strict leather-queen or &lsquo;clone&rsquo; dress codes.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p06crxq7\"}}</p><p>&ldquo;One thing that&rsquo;s come out of Queer Looks is that lesbians in the 1960s cherished their clothes less &ndash; avoiding fashion was political for them,&rdquo; says Pel. &ldquo;They wanted to be valued for what was in their heads, not for their appearance.&rdquo;</p><blockquote><p> My style rises above the stereotypes of being feminine, of being a woman &ndash; Ellie Medhurst </p></blockquote><p>By contrast, for Ellie Medhurst, a lesbian in her early 20s, dressing flamboyantly is integral to her identity. She is never seen in anything but pink and claims that, by knowingly embracing this extreme, she is transcending the cliche that pink is oppressively &lsquo;feminine&rsquo; and retrograde. &ldquo;My style rises above the stereotypes of being feminine, of being a woman,&rdquo; she says.</p><p>Candice Armah &ndash; 26, black, and non-binary (not defined by traditional polarised categories of male and female or gay and heterosexual) &ndash;&nbsp;often wears a T-shirt with the slogan &lsquo;Black History is World History&rsquo; by Brighton label Sassy Tees, which dedicates itself to &ldquo;anti-racist organising and Pan-Africanist networking.&rdquo;</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p06crxl1\"}}</p><p>Film-maker and activist Fox Fisher, also non-binary and founder of Brighton&rsquo;s Trans Pride, declares allegiances in a T-shirt emblazoned with &lsquo;Trans Pride&rsquo; teamed with rugged utility clothing that hints at militancy, including &ldquo;well-worn&rdquo; boots like those of a &ldquo;foot soldier, fighting for trans rights&rdquo;.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p06crxxk\"}}</p><p>An Nguyen &ndash; a gender-fluid, Vietnamese man, born in 1995, who later moved from Singapore, where he was at school and where same-sex is illegal, to Brighton &ndash; says, &ldquo;I stayed low-key in Singapore&rdquo;.

Following Kahlo&rsquo;s death, Rivera had locked the 6,000 photographs, 300 personal items and garments, plus 12,000 documents, away in the bathroom of the house. When they were finally revealed, it took four years for historians to sort and catalogue them, and for the first time, these artefacts and clothes have left the Blue House to be displayed at London&rsquo;s Victoria and Albert Museum.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p06b6dz4\"}}</p><p>In the exhibition <a href=\"https://www.vam.ac.uk/exhibitions/frida-kahlo-making-her-self-up\">Frida Kahlo: Making Her Self Up</a>, the artist&rsquo;s dresses and other personal effects are displayed alongside her paintings, showing the intimate connection between the two. &nbsp;She is presented as a kind of performance artist, whose whole self or identity was an extension of her art.

Her corsets were necessary for medical reasons but she also elaborately decorated them. The traditional indigenous dress style she adopted allowed her to conceal these items under long skirts and geometric cut blouses.&rdquo;</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p06b6hfz\"}}</p><p>&ldquo;I think Kahlo&rsquo;s powerful style is as integral to her myth as her paintings. It is her construction of identity through her ethnicity, her disability, her political beliefs and her art,&rdquo; says Henestrosa, who also curated the first ever exhibition of the artist&rsquo;s wardrobe, at the Frida Kahlo Museum in 2012. By the time Kahlo adopted the traditional Tehuana dress, she wanted to look quintessentially Mexican, explains Henestrosa, and the Tehuana dress comes from the Tehuantepec Isthmus, a matriarchal society in the southeast of Mexico.</p><p>&ldquo;Frida understood the power of dress from a very early age,&rdquo; the curator explains. &ldquo;As a result of her polio at the age of six, she was left with a withered and shorter right leg, something that led her to choose long skirts. She began wearing three to four socks on her thinner calf and also wore shoes with a built-up heel to mask her asymmetry. This shows how she established a relationship between her body and dress from a very early age. Through the use of her self-portraits and the use of traditional Mexican dresses to style herself, Kahlo dealt with her life, her political views, her health struggles, her accident, and her turbulent marriage.&rdquo;</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p06bdvm5\"}}</p><p>The sense of unlocking hidden treasures is central to the exhibition, as its co-designer, Tom Scutt, tells BBC Culture: &ldquo;There is such a spirit of time and place about this unique exhibition. The action of unlocking a room in the Blue House to discover all these belongings of Frida&rsquo;s is echoed in the notion of arriving at an exhibition as a visitor and discovering the belongings oneself. Because of this, the exhibition holds an indisputable, magical charge.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>&lsquo;Duality, reflection, repetition&rsquo;</strong></p><p>The exhibition explores Kahlo&rsquo;s childhood, and includes an album of architectural church photographs by her German father Guillermo Kahlo. Also shown are early photos and paintings of Kahlo and Rivera with their circle of famous friends, including Leon Trotsky. Kahlo&rsquo;s cultural pride following the Mexican Revolution (1910-20) is also further illuminated by the previously hidden items &ndash; her interest in the arts, crafts and traditions of the indigenous people of Mexico was a passion. The period of the 1920s and 30s saw what became known as a &lsquo;Mexican Renaissance&rsquo;, with the country attracting artists, writers, photographers and film-makers from all over the world. Photographs by Edward Weston and Tina Modotti taken in the 1920s are also displayed. And there is a wall of <em>ex votos </em>from Kahlo and Rivera&rsquo;s collection. The small, tin votive paintings that were offered up to the saints, were an influence on Kahlo&rsquo;s art.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p06b6hrc\"}}</p><p>Garments on show include <em>rebozos</em> (traditional Mexican shawl),&nbsp; <em>huipiles</em> (embroidered square-cut top), <em>enaguas</em> and <em>holanes</em>, long skirts, and jewellery including Columbian jade beans and modern silverwork. There is a <em>resplandor</em>, a lace headdress traditionally worn by the women of Isthmus, alongside a portrait of Kahlo wearing it. And also on show is the artist&rsquo;s original Revlon red lipstick and the kohl she used to define her famous, signature monobrow.</p><p>The aim was to create a pedestal in which the subject can speak for itself, says Scutt: &ldquo;We hope we have created an experience that carries with it echoes, ghosts of ideas that are reminiscent of the influences in her life but always to have avoided pastiche. It should feel as much 2018 London as it does 1940s Mexico.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p06b6hz5\"}}&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Frida&rsquo;s life was full of duality and complex opposite ideas, the notion of looking at oneself in the mirror to paint a self-portrait therefore became central [to the exhibition],&rdquo; says the designer. &ldquo;It is this duality, reflection, repetition that we have tried to expand across the exhibition to give visitors a sense of the duality within her. I was also keen that we gave a sense of looking at the world from a different angle. There is a photograph that starts our exhibition of Frida reflected in the mirror that hung above her on her four-poster bed.</p><blockquote><p> During Kahlo&rsquo;s lifetime she was sometimes viewed as &lsquo;exotic' or patronised, &lsquo;othered&rsquo; but today &ndash; her intersectional, and complex, self-constructed identity is better understood and is inspiring &ndash; Circe Henestrosa </p></blockquote><p>&ldquo;I really enjoyed the distorted world view that that image threw up and the ripples of what it means on a wider view about artistry and disability. I was very keen that the experience somehow embraced and reflected the notion of having a different perspective on the world, thus there are echoes throughout of tilting, leaning, sloping and angled surfaces that crack open and emit light from within. We took inspiration from Frida&rsquo;s garden podium and I looked a lot at Mayan pyramids to examine the crossovers of this idea and pre-Columbian architecture. In this way we have attempted to fuse the very personal experience through Frida&rsquo;s eyes, with a much wider sense of the world around her.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>&lsquo;Inherently modern&rsquo;</strong></p><p>Matt Thornley of Gibson Thornley Architects, who co-designed the exhibition with Scutt, says that Kahlo&rsquo;s &ldquo;complexity&rdquo; is central.</p><p>&ldquo;The outward image of Frida is so powerful,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;The photographic portraits are bursting with colour and life, as are her paintings. The exhibition explores this but also her physical fragility and inner strength. It is these complexities that make her such an interesting and enduring figure.</p><p>And like the artist herself, the design of the exhibition is &ldquo;inherently modern&rdquo; says Thornley. &ldquo;It acts as a backdrop to the objects and paintings that describe key events in her life. The exhibition explores Frida&rsquo;s roots and her position within the wider context of art, culture and politics in 1920s and 1930s Mexico. However we didn&rsquo;t want to imitate the imagery associated with this time. Instead the team were interested in exploring themes directly associated with her life. Working on the exhibition has allowed us to learn so much more about her &ndash; her strength in the face of personal adversity, her bravery and also humour.&rdquo;</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p06bdvxm\"}}</p><p>Kahlo&rsquo;s individualism, energy and modernity have made her an undisputed icon. But will she continue to influence future generations? Co-curator Circe Henestrosa thinks so: &ldquo;Definitely,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;Frida Kahlo is the very model of the bohemian artist: unique, rebellious and contradictory, a cult figure that continues to be appropriated by feminists, artists, fashion designers and popular culture. As a woman, an artist, an icon, Kahlo has achieved a rare, almost universal, acclaim. In a society often obsessed with tearing down the walls of the private self, Kahlo is the very embodiment of the ethos <em>du jour</em>. The dress choices she made reflected an intuitive ability to use a bold visual image in a time when men dominated the art world, and it was through art and dress that she conveyed her political beliefs at the same time that she dealt with her disabilities.&rdquo;</p><p>And one thing is certain, Kahlo&rsquo;s feminist and countercultural passions chime perfectly with current times. As Henestrosa puts it: &ldquo;During Kahlo&rsquo;s lifetime she was sometimes viewed as &lsquo;exotic' or patronised, &lsquo;othered&rsquo; but today &ndash; her intersectional, and complex, self-constructed identity is better understood and is inspiring. So this is the message we want to convey in this exhibition. She was a Mexican, female artist who was disabled, looking for a place as a female artist in a highly male-dominated environment in Mexico City. Aren&rsquo;t we fighting as women for the same today? How much more relevant, and refreshing for our times she can be?&rdquo;</p><p><em><a href=\"https://www.vam.ac.uk/exhibitions/frida-kahlo-making-her-self-up\">Frida Kahlo: Making Her Self Up</a> is at the Victoria and Albert Museum, London from 16 June </em>&ndash;<em> 4 November 2018. </em></p><p><em>If you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Culture, head over to our&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/BBC-Culture/237388053065908\"><strong><em>Facebook</em></strong></a><em>&nbsp;page or message us on</em>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbc_culture\"><strong><em>Twitter</em></strong></a><em>.</em></p><p><em>And if you liked this story,&nbsp;</em><a href=\"http://pages.emails.bbc.com/subscribe/\"><strong>sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter</strong></a><em>, called &ldquo;If You Only Read 6 Things This Week&rdquo;.

And no wonder. On Saturday, when Meghan walks down the aisle at St George&rsquo;s, Windsor, the fortunes of whichever fashion house she chooses will change forever.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p0674l8d\"}}</p><p>If you&rsquo;ve been muttering &lsquo;nice enough girl,&rsquo; &lsquo;what&rsquo;s the fuss?&rsquo;, you&rsquo;re not alone. Many are finding the kerfuffle excessive. Others, however, would beg to differ. In six short months, Meghan has become one of fashion&rsquo;s most significant influencers &ndash; bigger, according to global fashion search platform Lyst, than the Kardashians or the Hadid sisters, Gigi and Bella.</p><p>When Markle attended the Invictus Games with Harry last September, for example, wearing a pair of tortoiseshell &lsquo;Percy&rsquo; sunglasses, sales at the British brand Finlay &amp; Co shot up by more than 1,000 per cent. What Meghan wears counts. No wonder top British fashion brands have been staring at their phones for the past six months.</p><blockquote><p> Meghan offers a masterclass in blending Californian breeziness with showbiz glam </p></blockquote><p>Every royal wedding attracts attention; this one is something else. Meghan Markle is a 36-year-old California native, a denizen of Hollywood, a former actress in a popular TV drama. She is also whip smart, big-hearted and as ferociously contemporary as supermodel Adwoa Aboah on the cover of Vogue. In choosing Markle to be his wife, Harry has, arguably, pulled the monarchy into the 21st Century.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p06746sg\"}}</p><p>Ever since the engagement was announced in November, the couple have forged new paths, inviting youth charity workers and community leaders to the wedding instead of political leaders; asking for donations to small charities instead of gifts. In this context, the frenzy over &lsquo;the dress&rsquo; &ndash;&nbsp; the concrete expression of everything Meghan and Harry stand for &ndash; makes more sense.</p><p>Pundits have been scouring Meghan&rsquo;s personal style for clues. Honed in LA and on the Canadian sets of TV legal drama Suits, Meghan offers a masterclass in blending Californian breeziness with showbiz glam. The result is a look many women aspire to: polished but not prim, sophisticated but not laboured, beautiful but not annoyingly so. Strength cloaked in style.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p0678jx2\"}}</p><p>&ldquo;She has a very relaxed way of dressing, understated and unfussy, accessible and relatable,&rdquo; says Kenya Hunt, deputy editor and fashion features director of Elle UK. &ldquo;At the same time, she can be quite glamorous. This is a woman who comes from the world of red carpets, and understands the power of dress.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a refreshing modernity there,&rdquo; senior fashion editor at The Telegraph, Charlie Gowans-Eglinton reminds us. &ldquo;The idea of a woman wearing a black trouser suit [Meghan wore a cropped Alexander McQueen suit to the Endeavour Fund Awards in February] might not be shocking &ndash; but, on a royal, it is.&rdquo;</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p067442c\"}}</p><p>In a perfect world, if Meghan could have her global pick of labels, she could do a lot worse than turn to the new bridal collection from Dutch conceptualists Viktor&amp;Rolf. From the cap-sleeved empire lined gown, topped with a satin bow, to outrageously generous tulle ball skirts, the aesthetic would have chimed perfectly with Meghan&rsquo;s refined but modernist taste. But even the bride of Harry has constraints. &ldquo;As an American marrying into the British royal family, a British label would be the most diplomatic choice &hellip;&rdquo; points out Gowans-Eglinton.</p><p>Obviously, Meghan has had to adapt. Flick through images of Markle pre- and post-engagement and even the most indifferent observer will note that shapes have become more sculptural, hemlines longer, and hats are in. Where Meghan continues to impress is in her ability to make every outfit subtly but surely her own. From mismatched earrings here to a subtly punky thumb ring there, Meghan offers the very definition of classic with a twist.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p0674521\"}}</p><p>And that, say experts, is what we can expect to find in the royal wedding dress. Eschew notions of blowsy confections like Princess Diana&rsquo;s ivory silk taffeta and antique lace gown by David and Elizabeth Emmanuel &ndash; now too traditional by far &ndash; and look instead for inspiration closer to home: to the wedding dress of Meghan&rsquo;s soon-to-be sister in law the Duchess of Cambridge.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p06744qc\"}}</p><p>Interestingly, both Kate and her sister Pippa plumped for highly respected British designers with an undertow of genuine rebellion. Sarah Burton at Alexander McQueen, a label known for blending motifs of nature and death, designed Kate&rsquo;s triumph of a gown, which featured a sculpted satin bodice, slight padding at the hips (a signature McQueen motif) and lace roses, thistles, daffodils and shamrocks (to represent a United Kingdom).</p><p>Pippa turned to couturier Giles Deacon, another designer with not-so-hidden depths, to create a bridal gown for her wedding to James Matthews last May. Previously, Deacon had specialised in disorientating <em>trompe l&rsquo;oeil</em> prints on flamboyant silhouettes; for Middleton, he made an elegant dress that stated its modernity in its dramatic high neck and capped sleeves.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p067d7k6\"}}</p><p>In past interviews, Meghan herself has cited Carolyn Bessette Kennedy as a bridal-style inspiration, calling the wife of John Kennedy Junior's slinky slip &ldquo;everything goals&rdquo; but this was from a pre-world stage. Those clean lines would soon be lost in the hallowed halls of St George&rsquo;s.</p><p>Equally good to consider has been the roll call of top British talent that Meghan has been able to draw upon for official engagements: from the white coat and navy dress by &lsquo;clean glam&rsquo; queen Amanda Wakeley that Markle wore for the Commonwealth Day Service, to Jenny Packham, the Duchess of Cambridge&rsquo;s current go-to designer for post-birth glamour.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p06747z9\"}}</p><p>And of course, wouldn&rsquo;t it be glorious if Meghan used the global platform to celebrate her ethical beliefs &ndash; by plumping for a sustainably produced gown by the likes of Vivienne Westwood, simultaneously the <em>enfant terrible</em> and <em>grande dame</em> of political fashion, or Stella McCartney, trailblazer for ethical British design?</p><p>Who knows, Meghan&rsquo;s penchant for smaller labels could even emerge in picking Mother of Pearl, which recently launched an environmentally conscious bridal collection. &ldquo;With the clothing industry in such a need for change for social and environmental reasons, this would be the perfect opportunity to pave the way for a much-needed movement,&rdquo; says creative directory Amy Powney, wistfully. We can but dream &hellip;</p><p><strong>&nbsp;Odds-on favourites</strong></p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p067513s\"}}</p><p>Because, for now, three labels have now emerged as clear frontrunners. First up Christopher Bailey, with whom Meghan has a long friendship. The outgoing creative director of ultimate Brit brand Burberry provided Prince Harry&rsquo;s fianc&eacute;e with a range of outfits during her stint at Suits; in February, Markle donned a tartan coat by Burberry for an official engagement in Edinburgh.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p067433f\"}}</p><p>Canadian-born, London-based designer Erdem Moralioglu has also lingered at the top of the wish list. His penchant for turning wearers into ethereal walking gardens with all-over florals placed over quirkily feminine silhouettes has made him a long-time favourite with young royals; Princess Eugenie wore Erdem for her official engagement portraits with fianc&eacute; Jack Brooksbank.</p><blockquote><p> One thing is certain: whatever happens, it will be historic </p></blockquote><p>The odds-on favourite, however, is currently Ralph &amp; Russo. If that is the case, the clues have been clunky. It was the couple Tamara Ralph and Michael Russo who designed the striking, semi-sheer, feather-embroidered gown Meghan wore in her engagement photos. The duo are&nbsp; Australian but have been based in Britain for more than a decade.&nbsp;</p><p>As Britain&rsquo;s only <em>haute-couture</em> house, with a built-in bridal line, the label ticks all the boxes. Plus, there&rsquo;s the aesthetic of sumptuous silhouettes with trains that last forever &ndash; corners can be a challenge for the Ralph &amp; Russo bride. So much for the classic. What about the famous twist? At Ralph &amp; Russo, that comes with scale: January&rsquo;s <em>haute-couture</em> show closed with a grand, flounced skirt complete with pearlescent micro beads and scalloped lace veil. Enough said.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p06743pk\"}}</p><p>For all the fashion designers currently wiping their eyes in disappointment but learning to breathe again, the news may come as a blow (although, on the upside, Meghan will also require a change of clothes for the reception, which is also a great opportunity). One thing is certain: whatever happens, it will be historic.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p0678mjz\"}}</p><p>&ldquo;With more than 15 years as an actress under her belt, Meghan strikes me as someone who fully understands the power of an image,&rdquo; concludes Elle&rsquo;s Kenya Hunt. &ldquo;Her wedding will be one for the history books, to which future weddings will be compared. Her dress will be no exception, and I&rsquo;m sure this fact isn&rsquo;t lost on her. It&rsquo;s been fun watching Meghan assert her individuality throughout this engagement, and I hope her dress will do the same.&rdquo;</p><p><em>To comment on and see more stories from BBC Designed, you can follow us on&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCDesigned/\"><strong><em>Facebook</em></strong></a><em>,&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBC_designed\"><strong><em>Twitter</em></strong></a><em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/BBC_designed/\"><strong><em>Instagram</em></strong></a><em>.</em></p><p>&nbsp;<em>And if you liked this story,&nbsp;</em><a href=\"http://pages.emails.bbc.com/subscribe/\"><strong>sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter</strong></a><em>, called &ldquo;If You Only Read 6 Things This Week&rdquo;.

    </a></div></p><p>Architect Kenzo Tange kick-started the decade-long Metabolism movement, which incorporated innovative technologies and the use of modular units in architecture. He designed the 1960 Plan for Tokyo proposal, during a period of peak urban development in Japan. The project was designed to accommodate expansion in Tokyo by creating architecture that connected across the Tokyo Bay. It led to a new way of approaching urban design. Tange envisioned the use of a grand axis that would cross the bay and provide platforms for creatively designed buildings.</p><blockquote><p> The project promoted the concept of a floating metropolis in the ocean </p></blockquote><p>In 1966, Tange further developed his urban ideas when he designed the Yamanashi Broadcasting and Press Centre in Kofu. Created for three separate media companies, the building housed a newspaper printing plant, a radio station, and a television studio. To maximise space, Tange grouped similar functions of each office together, putting the newspaper printing machinery on the ground floor, the studios on the upper floors, and the office on glass-walled floors surrounded by balconies. Space was left within the structure to provide for future expansion, but it has now been used for gardens and terraces.</p><p><div class="inline-media inline-image">

    </a></div></p><p>The 1958 Marine City project by visionary architect Kiyonori Kikutake was one of the first major ideas of the Metabolism movement, promoting the concept of a floating metropolis in the ocean. The structure would be self-sustainable, flexible, clean, earthquake-proof and flood resistant. It would also be located away from urban life on the mainland, using large steel rings with magnetic towers to hold its circular foundations in place. Ideally, the foundations would float on bottle-like forms, creating a rich aqua-culture farming industry. Kikutake&rsquo;s alternative living concept was radical at the time, but it was one of the first ideas to address issues of sustainability and modularity.</p><p><div class="inline-media inline-image">

    </a></div></p><p>Another project that helped Japanese architects create a showcase for innovation in architecture was the Joint Core System (or City in the Air) which was developed in 1960 by Arata Isozaki. His plan included a multi-layered city with highways and parking structures woven between compounds of offices and apartments. In the original sketches, these structures look like trees, growing side by side. The branches function like passageways to living units, while the trunks act as large supports. This project is sometimes referred to as &lsquo;Clusters in the Air,&rsquo; as the trees develop and create a forest-like structure.</p><p><strong>The race for space</strong></p><p>Architect Kisho Kurokawa was a leader in the Metabolism movement in the 1960s, and his first Metabolic structure, Helix City, was prompted by a growing lack of space in Japan. The idea was to build a structure that functioned more efficiently and sensibly. Constructed with an organic design made up of a series of linked, helical structures, Helix City relies upon service towers that are connected by an infrastructure of bridges over both land and sea. Residential buildings fill in gaps in between the towers, creating a pattern that could hypothetically continue endlessly. This design was inspired by the 1953 discovery of DNA, a significant turning point for the study of life forms.</p><p><div class="inline-media inline-image">

    </a></div></p><p>Kurokawa&rsquo;s 1960 design for Agricultural City began after the architect survived the Ise Bay Typhoon in 1959. This project was created to prevent a habitat from being flooded by using a grid-like structure of concrete slabs, raised on stilts on agricultural soil, to synchronise the rural landscape with living areas. The grid provides for roads, water services, electricity, monorails, and structures like schools and administration buildings. Housing is designed in a mushroom shape &ndash; one to three floors, a wooden frame, and an aluminium cap. Though living units are separate, the linking together of these units creates a village. The entire grid would consist of enough space for about 200 people and a water system would be established beneath the complex.</p><blockquote><p> The architecture could grow and change as needed throughout the years </p></blockquote><p>From 1970 to 1972 Kurowaka and his team designed the Nakagin Capsule Tower in Ginza, Tokyo. This was the first-ever capsule-architecture design, created with the aim of housing businesspeople who would stay in the city during the week. The building represented a prototype for architecture that stressed sustainability and recyclability. Each of the 140 modules could be added to the central core or replaced and exchanged when necessary. This flexibility provided convenient methods of housing for the relatively brief stays of these visitors. Standing at 14 storeys high, the building was an initiative of the Metabolism movement to provide adaptable and interchangeable designs in cities.</p><p><div class="inline-media inline-image">

    </a></div></p><p>Also based on Metabolic principles was Kurokawa&rsquo;s 1966 project Resort Centre Yamagata Hawaii. The architect purposefully designed this building with the intention of creating no centre, so as to represent fluidity and motion. The Resort Centre Yamagata Hawaii Dreamland appealed to people who were beginning to travel postwar in Japan by instilling leisure and rest. The structure was very Metabolic, and its architecture could grow and change as needed to transform its shape throughout the years. The building was demolished around 1975, and residential towers were built in its place instead.</p><p>The ideas of architect Masato Otaka, meanwhile, did not gain as much international recognition as some of his colleagues&rsquo;, but his designs relied upon key elements of the Metabolism movement. From 1962, Otaka&rsquo;s housing development Sakaide Artificial Ground relied upon concrete building methods to create a new kind of urbanism in a social housing project on Shikoku Island. Otaka designed an artificial ground plane slightly above grade to allow buildings to interact more flexibly. This design took around 20 years to develop, overlapping with the fruition of the Urban Redevelopment Law in 1969.</p><p><div class="inline-media inline-image">

    </a></div></p><p>The Golgi Structure by architect Fumihiko Maki took its name from Nobel-Prize winner Camillo Golgi, a scientist who found a way to visualise nerve-cell bodies. Maki&rsquo;s structure combines dense urban area with unstructured open spaces to create an alternating effect. The open spaces in the structure are contained by light-absorbing cells that enable communication and energy distribution. This aspect of the project was key to Maki who stressed the idea of the collective form through three specific types: compositional, structural and sequential. The Golgi Structure contributed to this concept through the use of open spaces, providing mobility for residents and giving them an opportunity to interact with one another in a social environment. It was a quintessentially Metabolic design.</p><p>&nbsp;<em>To comment on and see more stories from BBC Designed, you can follow us on&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.facebook.com/BBCDesigned/"><em><strong>Facebook</strong></em></a><em>,&nbsp;</em><a href="https://twitter.com/bbc_designed?lang=en"><em><strong>Twitter</strong></em></a><em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.instagram.com/bbc_designed/?hl=en"><em><strong>Instagram</strong></em></a><em>.</em></p>

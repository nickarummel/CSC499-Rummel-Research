Fine. But do you have to put our lives in danger?&quot; - Katy Tur to TrumpAn amazing monologue standing up for the press after the Capital Gazette shooting and exposing threats journalists endure from the President&#x27;s base.pic.twitter.com/DJN1QQAcKx — Adam Best (@adamcbest) August 3, 2018 Tur ripped into Trump for continuing to insult and call the press the &quot;enemy of the people,&quot; despite a recent shooting at the Capital Gazette newspaper that left five people dead. She brought up the fact that the publisher of the New York Times, A.G. Sulzberger, recently stressed to the president that his words were putting journalists in mortal danger. And she followed it up with a mention of CNN White House reporter Jim Acosta being berated by Trump supporters at a rally the president held in Florida on Wednesday.  Tur then masterfully used Trump&#x27;s favorite child to prove her point: Ivanka contradicted her father&#x27;s statements that the press was the enemy on Thursday during an interview with Axios.  &quot;Sadly, the threats and harassment aren&#x27;t stopping, journalists get them every day,&quot; Tur said, noting that the vitriol has only increased since Trump urged his crowds to yell and scream at the press during his rallies on the campaign trail. Tur even opened up about some threats she&#x27;s received from Trump supporters.  &quot;I hope you get raped and killed,&quot; someone emailed Tur this week, signing off the email with Trump&#x27;s MAGA campaign slogan. But perhaps Tur&#x27;s most powerful burn came subtly at the end of her statement, after she pleaded with those close to Trump to say something to him about the dangers this poses to democracy.  &quot;Obviously, I&#x27;m not talking to you, Sarah Sanders,&quot; Tur said. &quot;You made it clear where you stand yesterday.&quot; On Thursday, Acosta left the press briefing room in protest after getting into a heated exchange with press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who refused to break line with Trump and say that the media was not the enemy of the people.  Acosta later appeared on CNN to clear up why he walked out.  Fellow Americans are not the enemy of fellow Americans,&quot; Acosta said.  Tur&#x27;s no stranger to Trump&#x27;s personal attacks. The two famously butted heads on the campaign trail — and she went on to write a book about the experience.

The request was made even though the Federal Communications Commission voted along party lines to toss out the 2015 rules late last year, rendering the fight over their legality moot. In a filing to the Supreme Court, the Trump administration said the question for the court was &quot;whether the now-superseded 2015 order was invalid because it exceeded the FCC&#x27;s statutory authority, was arbitrary and capricious, was promulgated without adequate public notice, or violated the First Amendment.&quot; The FCC&#x27;s decision to repeal the 2015 net neutrality rules was widely considered a victory for internet service providers, or ISPs, like Verizon Communications Inc or Comcast Corp, over internet companies like Netflix Inc or Facebook Inc which depend on ISPs to carry their content to customers.</p></div></div></div></li><li class="js-stream-content Pos(r)" data-reactid="387"><div class="Py(14px) Pos(r)" data-test-locator="mega" data-reactid="388"><div class="Cf" data-reactid="389"><div class="Fl(start) Pos(r) Mt(2px) W(26.5%) Maw(220px)" data-reactid="390"><div class="H(0) Ov(h) Bdrs(2px)" style="padding-bottom:56%;" data-reactid="391"><img class="JsEnabled_Op(0) JsEnabled_Bg(n) Trsdu(.42s) Bgr(nr) Bgz(cv) W(100%) Trsdu(0s)!

Environmentalists, who had sued to bring about the 2-year-old ban, said on Friday that lifting the restriction poses a grave threat to pollinating insects and other sensitive creatures relying on toxic-free habitats afforded by wildlife refuges. \"Industrial agriculture has no place on refuges dedicated to wildlife conservation and protection of some of the most vital and vulnerable species,\" said Jenny Keating, federal lands policy analyst for the group Defenders of Wildlife. Limited agricultural activity is authorized on some refuges by law, including cooperative agreements in which farmers are permitted to grow certain crops to produce more food or improve habitat for the wildlife there. The rollback, spelled out in a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service memo, ends a policy that had prohibited farmers on refuges from planting biotech crops - such as soybeans and corn - engineered to resist insect pests and weed-controlling herbicides. That policy also had barred the use on wildlife refuges of neonicotinoid pesticides, or neonics, in conjunction with GMO crops. Neonics are a class of insecticides tied by research to declining populations of wild bees and other pollinating insects around the world. Rather than continuing to impose a blanket ban on GMO crops and neonics on refuges, Fish and Wildlife Service Deputy Director Greg Sheehan said in Thursday's memo that decisions about their use would be made on a case-by-case basis. Sheehan said the move was needed to ensure adequate forage for migratory birds, including ducks and geese – favored and hunted by sportsmen on many of the nation's refuges. U.S. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, whose department oversees the Fish and Wildlife Service, has made expansion of hunting on public lands a priority for his agency. Sheehan wrote that genetically modified organisms have helped \"maximize production, and that neonicotinoids might be needed \"to fulfill needed farming practices.\" It marked the latest in a series of Obama-era environmental restrictions to be reversed under Trump, his Republican successor, who campaigned on a pledge to roll back government regulations. In a 2014 Obama administration memo announcing plans to phase in the ban, Jim Kurth, head of the refuge system, wrote that seeds treated with neonics give rise to plants whose tissues contained compounds that could harm \"non-target\" species. He also said, \"refuges throughout the country successfully meet wildlife management objectives without\" GMOs or neonics. Thursday's memo named 50-plus national wildlife refuges across the country where the revised policy now applies. The entire system consists 560 refuge units encompassing roughly 150 million acres nationwide.

Environmentalists, who had sued to bring about the 2-year-old ban, said on Friday that lifting the restriction poses a grave threat to pollinating insects and other sensitive creatures relying on toxic-free habitats afforded by wildlife refuges. \"Industrial agriculture has no place on refuges dedicated to wildlife conservation and protection of some of the most vital and vulnerable species,\" said Jenny Keating, federal lands policy analyst for the group Defenders of Wildlife. Limited agricultural activity is authorized on some refuges by law, including cooperative agreements in which farmers are permitted to grow certain crops to produce more food or improve habitat for the wildlife there. The rollback, spelled out in a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service memo, ends a policy that had prohibited farmers on refuges from planting biotech crops - such as soybeans and corn - engineered to resist insect pests and weed-controlling herbicides. That policy also had barred the use on wildlife refuges of neonicotinoid pesticides, or neonics, in conjunction with GMO crops. Neonics are a class of insecticides tied by research to declining populations of wild bees and other pollinating insects around the world. Rather than continuing to impose a blanket ban on GMO crops and neonics on refuges, Fish and Wildlife Service Deputy Director Greg Sheehan said in Thursday's memo that decisions about their use would be made on a case-by-case basis. Sheehan said the move was needed to ensure adequate forage for migratory birds, including ducks and geese – favored and hunted by sportsmen on many of the nation's refuges. U.S. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, whose department oversees the Fish and Wildlife Service, has made expansion of hunting on public lands a priority for his agency. Sheehan wrote that genetically modified organisms have helped \"maximize production, and that neonicotinoids might be needed \"to fulfill needed farming practices.\" It marked the latest in a series of Obama-era environmental restrictions to be reversed under Trump, his Republican successor, who campaigned on a pledge to roll back government regulations. In a 2014 Obama administration memo announcing plans to phase in the ban, Jim Kurth, head of the refuge system, wrote that seeds treated with neonics give rise to plants whose tissues contained compounds that could harm \"non-target\" species. He also said, \"refuges throughout the country successfully meet wildlife management objectives without\" GMOs or neonics. Thursday's memo named 50-plus national wildlife refuges across the country where the revised policy now applies. The entire system consists 560 refuge units encompassing roughly 150 million acres nationwide.

But the idea is gaining little traction at the Pentagon, where the president's defense chief, Jim Mattis, says it would add burdensome bureaucracy and unwanted costs.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Pentagon acknowledges a need to revamp its much-criticized approach to defending U.S. economic and security interests in space, and it is moving in that direction. But it's unclear whether this will satisfy Trump, who wants to go even further by creating a separate military space service.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe administration intends to announce next week the results of a Pentagon study that is expected to call for creating a new military command — U.S. Space Command — to consolidate space warfighting forces and making other organizational changes short of establishing a separate service, which only Congress can do. Any legislative proposal to create a separate service would likely not be put on the table until next year.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EMattis, who said prior to Trump's \"Space Force\" announcement in June that he opposes creating a new branch of the military for space, said afterward that this would require \"a lot of detailed planning.\"\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EMattis is allied on this with key Republicans on Capitol Hill including Sen. James Inhofe, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee who opposes a separate Space Force but is open to creating a Space Command. The command would coordinate the use of space forces of existing services, such as those that operate military satellites, but would not be a separate service.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EMattis's chief spokeswoman, Dana W. White, said Friday he believes that consolidating space functions will \"ensure we move at the speed of relevancy. Space is a joint warfighting domain that the U.S. must dominate.\"\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ETrump mentioned as recently as Tuesday that he had ordered the Pentagon to begin the process of creating a Space Force as a new branch of the military, but he did not repeat the phrase he used in June — a \"separate but equal\" service. That may open the possibility of the Pentagon proposing to establish a cadre of space experts that would be part of a space \"corps\" attached to the Air Force rather than as a separate service.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOn Friday, Trump hailed the news that NASA has named the astronauts who will ride the first commercial capsules into orbit next year. \"We have the greatest facilities in the world and we are now letting the private sector pay to use them,\" he tweeted. \"Exciting things happening. Space Force!\"\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ETrump's focus has generated an unusual level of talk about space, but with little clarity.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\"At the moment, there is no concrete proposal on the table for what a Space Force will look like or what it will do,\" said Brian Weeden, an Air Force veteran who is director of program planning at the Secure World Foundation, which promotes peaceful uses of outer space. \"It's just sort of a notional concept.\"\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWeeden points out that creating a new service would not address what is generally seen as a need for a more coherent force to defend U.S. interests in space, since by law a service recruits, trains and equips troops but does not do combat. That is why a Space Command is being considered, since it would be the combat arm for space much as Central Command is the organization responsible for combat operations in the Middle East.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAside from the organizational issues, the Pentagon's role in space is under scrutiny because of a recognition that the United States is increasingly reliant on satellites that are difficult to protect in space. Satellites provide communications, navigation, intelligence and other services vital to the military and the economy. Whereas space has long been America's technological edge, it is increasingly seen as its Achilles' heel.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWar in space is not just Hollywood fiction. The U.S. intelligence agencies reported earlier this year that Russia and China are pursuing \"nondestructive and destructive\" anti-satellite weapons for use during a future war.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EA related problem that the Pentagon has struggled to address is the sluggish pace of developing and acquiring satellites through the Air Force Space and Missile Systems Center, which could be replaced by a new space development agency.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn an interim report to Congress in March on ways to reorganize its space organizations, the Pentagon said it is making changes to \"ensure that we are prepared for\" potential conflicts in space. This includes making satellites more resilient to potential attack by Russia or China.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EDeborah James, who was the civilian leader of the Air Force for the final three years of the Obama administration, said at a think tank forum Monday that creating a separate Space Force does not address the legitimate concerns about U.S. space defenses. One of the criticisms of the Air Force, which is the primary service responsible for military satellites, is that it devotes too little money and attention to space.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\"If money is your issue, Space Force is not your answer,\" she said. If the logic of creating a separate space service were applied broadly, she said, it would imply other radical changes such as creating a single nuclear service by combining management of the strategic nuclear weapons of the Air Force and Navy, which no one is considering.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E---\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAssociated Press reporter Lolita C.

But it's unclear whether this will satisfy Trump, who wants to go even further by creating a separate military space service.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe administration intends to announce next week the results of a Pentagon study that is expected to call for creating a new military command — U.S. Space Command — to consolidate space warfighting forces and making other organizational changes short of establishing a separate service, which only Congress can do. Any legislative proposal to create a separate service would likely not be put on the table until next year.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EMattis, who said prior to Trump's \"Space Force\" announcement in June that he opposes creating a new branch of the military for space, said afterward that this would require \"a lot of detailed planning.\"\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EMattis is allied on this with key Republicans on Capitol Hill including Sen. James Inhofe, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee who opposes a separate Space Force but is open to creating a Space Command. The command would coordinate the use of space forces of existing services, such as those that operate military satellites, but would not be a separate service.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EMattis's chief spokeswoman, Dana W.

That is why a Space Command is being considered, since it would be the combat arm for space much as Central Command is the organization responsible for combat operations in the Middle East.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAside from the organizational issues, the Pentagon's role in space is under scrutiny because of a recognition that the United States is increasingly reliant on satellites that are difficult to protect in space. Satellites provide communications, navigation, intelligence and other services vital to the military and the economy. Whereas space has long been America's technological edge, it is increasingly seen as its Achilles' heel.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWar in space is not just Hollywood fiction. The U.S. intelligence agencies reported earlier this year that Russia and China are pursuing \"nondestructive and destructive\" anti-satellite weapons for use during a future war.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EA related problem that the Pentagon has struggled to address is the sluggish pace of developing and acquiring satellites through the Air Force Space and Missile Systems Center, which could be replaced by a new space development agency.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn an interim report to Congress in March on ways to reorganize its space organizations, the Pentagon said it is making changes to \"ensure that we are prepared for\" potential conflicts in space. This includes making satellites more resilient to potential attack by Russia or China.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EDeborah James, who was the civilian leader of the Air Force for the final three years of the Obama administration, said at a think tank forum Monday that creating a separate Space Force does not address the legitimate concerns about U.S. space defenses. One of the criticisms of the Air Force, which is the primary service responsible for military satellites, is that it devotes too little money and attention to space.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\"If money is your issue, Space Force is not your answer,\" she said.

Lynch, Nathan Layne and Karen Freifeld ALEXANDRIA, Va. (Reuters) - An accountant for U.S. President Donald Trump's one-time campaign chairman Paul Manafort admitted in trial testimony on Friday that she helped backdate documents and falsify financial records at Manafort and his business partner's request to reduce his tax burden and help him qualify for loans. Cynthia Laporta, who prepared Manafort's tax returns starting in 2014, told a jury in federal court in Alexandria, Virginia, that she was testifying under an immunity agreement with the government to avoid being prosecuted as Manafort was charged with bank fraud and tax fraud. One member of the jury nodded in apparent agreement when U.S. District Judge T.S. Ellis cut off the prosecution's questioning to ask her if she was afraid of being prosecuted herself. \"Correct,\" answered Laporta, explaining that she went along with accounting maneuvers suggested by Manafort and his longtime business associate Rick Gates because she did not want to create problems for her firm or lose a top client. \"I very much regret it,\" Laporta said on the trial's fourth day as prosecutors build their case that Manafort hid tens of millions of dollars he earned working for pro-Russian politicians in Ukraine to evade taxes. Laporta, the 14th witness to testify for the prosecution, was the most damaging yet for Manafort in the first trial arising from Special Counsel Robert Mueller's probe of Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. election. Manafort has pleaded not guilty to 18 counts of bank and tax fraud and failing to disclose foreign bank accounts, charges that largely pre-date the five months Manafort worked for Trump, some of them as campaign chairman. Once the jury had been dismissed for the day, Ellis gave defense lawyers a green light for detailed cross examination of Laporta on Monday. \"You are not limited in your cross examination of her,\" Ellis said. Both Laporta and fellow accountant Philip Ayliff, her predecessor who handled Manafort's tax filings at the firm KWC, testified that they had no knowledge that Manafort controlled foreign bank accounts. The government has provided trial evidence of Manafort controlling a web of overseas accounts in Cyprus and elsewhere. Such accounts must be reported to tax authorities if they contain $10,000 or more. Laporta also detailed multiple examples in which Manafort and Gates sought to doctor financial records. One instance involved classifying revenue from a Cyprus-based company as a loan to lower his taxable income, Laporta testified. \"It’s hard-hitting testimony that creates an uphill battle for the defense, but that’s what cross examination is for,\" said Andrew Boutros, a former federal prosecutor who is now a white collar defense lawyer. \"I don’t know if there is enough to convict him right now, but they’re laying the groundwork for it.\" A conviction would give momentum to Mueller's probe, in which 32 people and three companies have been indicted or pleaded guilty. Trump, angered by any questions about the legitimacy of his election win, has called Mueller's investigation a witch hunt and wants it to be shut down. TARGETING GATES After spending the first two days of the trial laying out Manafort's lavish spending, the prosecution is now digging into how he accounted for the more than $60 million he made in Ukraine and his efforts to allegedly mislead banks to get loans once the income from Ukraine dropped off precipitously in 2014. Manafort's attorneys have signaled they will seek to blame Gates, who was Trump's deputy campaign chairman in 2016. Gates pleaded guilty in February and is expected to testify against Manafort, possibly next week. Prosecutor Uzo Asonye focused some of his questioning on money transfers from a Cyprus-based company called Telmar Investments Ltd, which records showed had paid Manafort's firm more than $5 million for consulting work. That income posed a problem for Manafort when it came time to prepare his business tax returns in September 2015, Laporta testified. She said Gates told her in a conference call the income level \"was too high\" and proposed reclassifying a portion of it as a loan. Laporta said she knew it was \"inappropriate\" but agreed to alter the records to show that Manafort’s firm received a $900,000 loan from Telmar in 2014, a change that would save Manafort nearly a half million dollars in taxes, Laporta said. Manafort signed an agreement to account for that loan that was backdated, according to Laporta and an exhibit shown to the jury. Trial consultant Roy Futterman, who is following the trial but not involved in it, said, \"The prosecution is doing a very good job of keeping a brisk pace, putting witnesses on for short direct examinations, keeping it lively and keeping very tight messages for each witness.\" Manafort's attorneys do not seem to have scored a lot of points on cross-examination, Futterman said, but added that the witnesses who have testified so far are not \"the main targets.\" Earlier on Friday prosecutors asked Ayliff about Manafort's accounting of a $1.5 million transfer in 2012 from Peranova Holdings Ltd as a loan, even as records showed that no interest or principal was paid on it in subsequent years. Peranova is one of numerous Cypriot entities that prosecutors have said Manafort controlled. Ayliff testified that KWC did not know Manafort controlled Peranova, and that if the transfer was a payment related to his consulting work in Ukraine it would have been treated as income - not as a loan - on his tax returns.

Lynch, Nathan Layne and Karen Freifeld ALEXANDRIA, Va. (Reuters) - An accountant for U.S. President Donald Trump's one-time campaign chairman Paul Manafort admitted in trial testimony on Friday that she helped backdate documents and falsify financial records at Manafort and his business partner's request to reduce his tax burden and help him qualify for loans. Cynthia Laporta, who prepared Manafort's tax returns starting in 2014, told a jury in federal court in Alexandria, Virginia, that she was testifying under an immunity agreement with the government to avoid being prosecuted as Manafort was charged with bank fraud and tax fraud. One member of the jury nodded in apparent agreement when U.S. District Judge T.S. Ellis cut off the prosecution's questioning to ask her if she was afraid of being prosecuted herself. \"Correct,\" answered Laporta, explaining that she went along with accounting maneuvers suggested by Manafort and his longtime business associate Rick Gates because she did not want to create problems for her firm or lose a top client. \"I very much regret it,\" Laporta said on the trial's fourth day as prosecutors build their case that Manafort hid tens of millions of dollars he earned working for pro-Russian politicians in Ukraine to evade taxes. Laporta, the 14th witness to testify for the prosecution, was the most damaging yet for Manafort in the first trial arising from Special Counsel Robert Mueller's probe of Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. election. Manafort has pleaded not guilty to 18 counts of bank and tax fraud and failing to disclose foreign bank accounts, charges that largely pre-date the five months Manafort worked for Trump, some of them as campaign chairman. Once the jury had been dismissed for the day, Ellis gave defense lawyers a green light for detailed cross examination of Laporta on Monday. \"You are not limited in your cross examination of her,\" Ellis said. Both Laporta and fellow accountant Philip Ayliff, her predecessor who handled Manafort's tax filings at the firm KWC, testified that they had no knowledge that Manafort controlled foreign bank accounts. The government has provided trial evidence of Manafort controlling a web of overseas accounts in Cyprus and elsewhere. Such accounts must be reported to tax authorities if they contain $10,000 or more. Laporta also detailed multiple examples in which Manafort and Gates sought to doctor financial records. One instance involved classifying revenue from a Cyprus-based company as a loan to lower his taxable income, Laporta testified. \"It’s hard-hitting testimony that creates an uphill battle for the defense, but that’s what cross examination is for,\" said Andrew Boutros, a former federal prosecutor who is now a white collar defense lawyer. \"I don’t know if there is enough to convict him right now, but they’re laying the groundwork for it.\" A conviction would give momentum to Mueller's probe, in which 32 people and three companies have been indicted or pleaded guilty. Trump, angered by any questions about the legitimacy of his election win, has called Mueller's investigation a witch hunt and wants it to be shut down. TARGETING GATES After spending the first two days of the trial laying out Manafort's lavish spending, the prosecution is now digging into how he accounted for the more than $60 million he made in Ukraine and his efforts to allegedly mislead banks to get loans once the income from Ukraine dropped off precipitously in 2014. Manafort's attorneys have signaled they will seek to blame Gates, who was Trump's deputy campaign chairman in 2016. Gates pleaded guilty in February and is expected to testify against Manafort, possibly next week. Prosecutor Uzo Asonye focused some of his questioning on money transfers from a Cyprus-based company called Telmar Investments Ltd, which records showed had paid Manafort's firm more than $5 million for consulting work. That income posed a problem for Manafort when it came time to prepare his business tax returns in September 2015, Laporta testified. She said Gates told her in a conference call the income level \"was too high\" and proposed reclassifying a portion of it as a loan. Laporta said she knew it was \"inappropriate\" but agreed to alter the records to show that Manafort’s firm received a $900,000 loan from Telmar in 2014, a change that would save Manafort nearly a half million dollars in taxes, Laporta said. Manafort signed an agreement to account for that loan that was backdated, according to Laporta and an exhibit shown to the jury. Trial consultant Roy Futterman, who is following the trial but not involved in it, said, \"The prosecution is doing a very good job of keeping a brisk pace, putting witnesses on for short direct examinations, keeping it lively and keeping very tight messages for each witness.\" Manafort's attorneys do not seem to have scored a lot of points on cross-examination, Futterman said, but added that the witnesses who have testified so far are not \"the main targets.\" Earlier on Friday prosecutors asked Ayliff about Manafort's accounting of a $1.5 million transfer in 2012 from Peranova Holdings Ltd as a loan, even as records showed that no interest or principal was paid on it in subsequent years. Peranova is one of numerous Cypriot entities that prosecutors have said Manafort controlled. Ayliff testified that KWC did not know Manafort controlled Peranova, and that if the transfer was a payment related to his consulting work in Ukraine it would have been treated as income - not as a loan - on his tax returns.

Manafort, 69, has pleaded not guilty to charges of bank fraud, tax fraud and failing to disclose foreign bank accounts.

Prosecutors have tried to make their case first by presenting testimony about Manafort's lavish lifestyle and then detailing his financial maneuvering. Defense attorneys have signaled they will seek to blame the financial charges against Manafort on his business partner Rick Gates, who was Trump's deputy campaign chairman in the 2016 presidential election. Laporta testified that Gates, in a conference call with her and another accountant at the firm, instructed them to alter a loan amount to lower Manafort's tax bill because it was too high for Manafort to pay. \"Rick said it was too high\" and that Manafort \"didn't have that money,\" Laporta said in response questions by prosecutor Uzo Asonye. Gates, who pleaded guilty in February to conspiracy and lying to the FBI, is cooperating with Mueller's probe, and is expected to testify later in the trial. The charges against Manafort largely pre-date the five months he worked for Trump, some of them as campaign chairman, during a pivotal period in the race for the White House. 'GOOD JOB' Trial consultant Roy Futterman, who is following the trial but not involved in it, said, \"The prosecution is doing a very good job of keeping a brisk pace, putting witnesses on for short direct examinations, keeping it lively and keeping very tight messages for each witness.\" Manafort's defense attorneys do not seem to have scored a lot of points on cross-examination, Futterman said, but added that the witnesses who have testified so far are not \"the main targets.\" Prosecutors asked Ayliff about Manafort's accounting of a $1.5 million transfer in 2012 from Peranova Holdings Ltd as a loan, even as records showed that no interest or principal was paid on it in subsequent years.

Ayliff testified that KWC did not know Manafort controlled Peranova, and that if the transfer was a payment related to his consulting work it would have been treated as income - not as a loan - on his tax returns. Kevin Downing, Manafort's attorney, signaled on Friday that his defense strategy might also involve raising questions about whether Manafort in fact had willfully deceived his accountants. One way to do that could be to show that documents Manafort had provided to the accountant contained details about foreign bank accounts. \"Only a fool would give that information to his accountant if he was trying to conceal it from the IRS,\" Downing said, referring to whether the accountant had names of the Cyprus-based entities in his files and had retained them for his records. Late on Thursday, Manafort filed an objection to the government's bid to block his legal team from raising the fact that he and his companies were never audited by the IRS. Mueller's team has argued that any such civil action is separate from the criminal charges at hand. (Reporting by Sarah N.

Lynch and Nathan Layne ALEXANDRIA, Va. (Reuters) - An accountant for U.S. President Donald Trump's former campaign chairman Paul Manafort testified on Friday that she prepared his tax returns despite her concerns about the propriety of classifying money he transferred from overseas as loans. U.S. District Judge T.S. Ellis asked the accountant, Cynthia Laporta, whether she was testifying under an immunity agreement with the government because she was concerned that she could be prosecuted. She answered, \"Correct.\" Laporta testified she knew an accounting treatment for a loan was wrong when preparing Manafort's tax return for 2014. \"I very much regret it,\" she told the courtroom. Her testimony came on the trial's fourth day as prosecutors sought to drive home their case that Manafort tried to hide millions of dollars he earned working for pro-Russian politicians in Ukraine. Manafort, 69, has pleaded not guilty to charges of bank fraud, tax fraud and failing to disclose foreign bank accounts. The trial in federal court in Alexandria, Virginia, is the first arising from Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation of Russia's role in the 2016 U.S. election. Both Laporta and fellow accountant Philip Ayliff, her predecessor who handled Manafort's tax filings at the firm KWC, testified that they had no knowledge that Manafort controlled foreign bank accounts. Such accounts must be reported to tax authorities if they contain $10,000 or more. Laporta said she asked Manafort directly about any such holdings and was told there were none. Prosecutors have tried to make their case first by presenting testimony about Manafort's lavish lifestyle and then detailing his financial maneuvering. Defense attorneys have signaled they will seek to blame the financial charges against Manafort on his business partner Rick Gates, who was Trump's deputy campaign chairman in the 2016 presidential election. Laporta testified that Gates, in a conference call with her and another accountant at the firm, instructed them to alter a loan amount to lower Manafort's tax bill because it was too high for Manafort to pay. \"Rick said it was too high\" and that Manafort \"didn't have that money,\" Laporta said in response questions by prosecutor Uzo Asonye. Gates, who pleaded guilty in February to conspiracy and lying to the FBI, is cooperating with Mueller's probe, and is expected to testify later in the trial. The charges against Manafort largely pre-date the five months he worked for Trump, some of them as campaign chairman, during a pivotal period in the race for the White House. 'GOOD JOB' Trial consultant Roy Futterman, who is following the trial but not involved in it, said, \"The prosecution is doing a very good job of keeping a brisk pace, putting witnesses on for short direct examinations, keeping it lively and keeping very tight messages for each witness.\" Manafort's defense attorneys do not seem to have scored a lot of points on cross-examination, Futterman said, but added that the witnesses who have testified so far are not \"the main targets.\" Prosecutors asked Ayliff about Manafort's accounting of a $1.5 million transfer in 2012 from Peranova Holdings Ltd as a loan, even as records showed that no interest or principal was paid on it in subsequent years. Peranova is one of numerous Cypriot entities that prosecutors have said Manafort controlled. Ayliff testified that KWC did not know Manafort controlled Peranova, and that if the transfer was a payment related to his consulting work it would have been treated as income - not as a loan - on his tax returns. Kevin Downing, Manafort's attorney, signaled on Friday that his defense strategy might also involve raising questions about whether Manafort in fact had willfully deceived his accountants. One way to do that could be to show that documents Manafort had provided to the accountant contained details about foreign bank accounts. \"Only a fool would give that information to his accountant if he was trying to conceal it from the IRS,\" Downing said, referring to whether the accountant had names of the Cyprus-based entities in his files and had retained them for his records. Late on Thursday, Manafort filed an objection to the government's bid to block his legal team from raising the fact that he and his companies were never audited by the IRS. Mueller's team has argued that any such civil action is separate from the criminal charges at hand. (Reporting by Sarah N.

If convicted, she could face 1.5 years in prison.  “I did not expect for it to turn out the way it did,\" Okoumou said. \"I just wanted to do what it is right.\"  “America, you motherfuckers, you drug addicts, you KKK, you fascist USA,\" she chanted after the hearing.  WATCH: Sarah Huckabee Sanders' most ludicrous moments as press secretary","author":{},"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.yahoo.com\u002Fnews\u002Fprotester-mocks-melania-trump-apos-223221440.html","provider":{"name":"Mashable","url":"http:\u002F\u002Fmashable.com\u002F","isPremiumProvider":false},"isHosted":true,"cover":{"image":{"originalUrl":"http:\u002F\u002Fmedia.zenfs.com\u002Fen-US\u002Fhomerun\u002Fnews.mashable\u002Ff890ddea376720e294ab1874a150aecc","originalHeight":480,"originalWidth":720,"resolutions":[{"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fs.yimg.com\u002Fuu\u002Fapi\u002Fres\u002F1.2\u002FcxZ2ExwTIWTHZtXnA8m1iw--\u002FYXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\u002Fhttp:\u002F\u002Fmedia.zenfs.com\u002Fen-US\u002Fhomerun\u002Fnews.mashable\u002Ff890ddea376720e294ab1874a150aecc","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fs.yimg.com\u002Fuu\u002Fapi\u002Fres\u002F1.2\u002FgNXP.YHrv_Agst1kocEAOQ--\u002FYXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0xMTM2O3c9NjQwOw--\u002Fhttp:\u002F\u002Fmedia.zenfs.com\u002Fen-US\u002Fhomerun\u002Fnews.mashable\u002Ff890ddea376720e294ab1874a150aecc","height":1136,"width":640,"tag":"large_image_640x1136"},{"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fs.yimg.com\u002Fuu\u002Fapi\u002Fres\u002F1.2\u002FopReZZibW5I_Wm_ENqmkOg--\u002FYXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD00ODA7dz03MjA7\u002Fhttp:\u002F\u002Fmedia.zenfs.com\u002Fen-US\u002Fhomerun\u002Fnews.mashable\u002Ff890ddea376720e294ab1874a150aecc","height":480,"width":720,"tag":"original"}]}},"title":"Protester mocks Melania Trump's 'I Really Don't Care' jacket at court appearance","images":[{"originalUrl":"http:\u002F\u002Fmedia.zenfs.com\u002Fen-US\u002Fhomerun\u002Fnews.mashable\u002Ff890ddea376720e294ab1874a150aecc","originalHeight":480,"originalWidth":720,"resolutions":[{"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fs.yimg.com\u002Fuu\u002Fapi\u002Fres\u002F1.2\u002FcxZ2ExwTIWTHZtXnA8m1iw--\u002FYXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7\u002Fhttp:\u002F\u002Fmedia.zenfs.com\u002Fen-US\u002Fhomerun\u002Fnews.mashable\u002Ff890ddea376720e294ab1874a150aecc","height":360,"width":640,"tag":"fit-width-640"},{"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fs.yimg.com\u002Fuu\u002Fapi\u002Fres\u002F1.2\u002FopReZZibW5I_Wm_ENqmkOg--\u002FYXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247Zmk9c3RyaW07aD00ODA7dz03MjA7\u002Fhttp:\u002F\u002Fmedia.zenfs.com\u002Fen-US\u002Fhomerun\u002Fnews.mashable\u002Ff890ddea376720e294ab1874a150aecc","height":480,"width":720,"tag":"original"}],"mimeType":"image\u002Fjpeg"}],"type":"link","uuid":"a0c32d04-8437-3888-bbc2-5496c8c82d07"},"type":"link","link":"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.yahoo.com\u002Fnews\u002Fprotester-mocks-melania-trump-apos-223221440.html","id":"v-433beca8-469f-3942-9fad-a13615dd8aa8_c-a0c32d04-8437-3888-bbc2-5496c8c82d07_a-a0c32d04-8437-3888-bbc2-5496c8c82d07","uuid":"a0c32d04-8437-3888-bbc2-5496c8c82d07","publisher":"Mashable","likes":{}},{"publishedAt":1533335213,"body":"\u003Cp\u003EPORTLAND, Maine (AP) — The now-disbanded voting integrity commission launched by the Trump administration uncovered no evidence to support claims of widespread voter fraud, according to an analysis of administration documents released Friday.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn a letter to Vice President Mike Pence and Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, who are both Republicans and led the commission, Maine Secretary of State Matthew Dunlap said the documents show there was a \"pre-ordained outcome\" and that drafts of a commission report included a section on evidence of voter fraud that was \"glaringly empty.\"\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\"It's calling into the darkness, looking for voter fraud,\" Dunlap, a Democrat, told The Associated Press. \"There's no real evidence of it anywhere.\"\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ERepublican President Donald Trump convened the commission to investigate the 2016 presidential election after making unsubstantiated claims that between 3 million and 5 million ballots were illegally cast.

She brought up the fact that the publisher of the New York Times, A.G. Sulzberger, recently stressed to the president that his words were putting journalists in mortal danger. And she followed it up with a mention of CNN White House reporter Jim Acosta being berated by Trump supporters at a rally the president held in Florida on Wednesday.  Tur then masterfully used Trump's favorite child to prove her point: Ivanka contradicted her father's statements that the press was the enemy on Thursday during an interview with Axios.  \"Sadly, the threats and harassment aren't stopping, journalists get them every day,\" Tur said, noting that the vitriol has only increased since Trump urged his crowds to yell and scream at the press during his rallies on the campaign trail. Tur even opened up about some threats she's received from Trump supporters.  \"I hope you get raped and killed,\" someone emailed Tur this week, signing off the email with Trump's MAGA campaign slogan.

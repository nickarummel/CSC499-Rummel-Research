The Associated Press contributed to this gallery.</em></p><p><strong>Jonathan Gold</strong> (July 28, 1960-July 21, 2018) was a classically-trained musician who played cello in punk bands. But his real talent was as a writer, and for four decades he covered the culinary landscape of Los Angeles, shifting the popular focus from Michelin-starred restaurants to the street food, diners, ethnic eateries and taco trucks that define the city's cuisine. His L.A. Times column Counter Intelligence, begun in 1986, helped introduce Angelenos to the lesser-known and tastier corners to be found in immigrant enclaves across the L.A. area. </p><p>In 2007, he became the first (and to date only) food critic to receive the Pulitzer Prize for criticism. The judges noted Gold's "zestful" writing that expressed "the delight of an erudite eater."</p><p>In an interview earlier this year Gold said, "I love going out to eat in the way a theater critic loves theater. I love going to farmers markets. I love sticking my hands in pots. And it turns out food is a pretty good prism through which to view humanity."</p></div>                <p class="credits"><span class="label">Credit:</span> Dan Steinberg/Invision/AP Images</p>                    </li>

"Somebody said: 'Here's a Spitfire &ndash; fly it, and if you break it, there will be bloody hell to pay,'" he recalled in 2013.</p><p>Serving with 92 Squadron, "Boy" (pictured at RAF Biggin Hill in Kent) was the youngest Spitfire pilot to defend Britain against the Luftwaffe. Surpassing the average four-week life expectancy of RAF pilots during the war, he flew between 50 and 60 sorties during the Battle of Britain, shooting down or damaging several German planes. Wellum was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross, and was later promoted to flight commander.&nbsp;</p><p>Years later, as he faced divorce and the loss of his house, he told the Independent, "I just wanted to sit quietly and convince myself that at some point in my life I had been of use." Wellum penned a memoir, which would later be published as the bestseller "First Light," hailed as a remarkably emotional tale of a young man coming of age inside the cockpit of a fighter plane. It was later turned into a BBC film, which Wellum himself judged to be the most authentic rendering of the Battle of Britain, surpassing even the 1969 epic "with all the big chaps in it," he told Forces TV.</p></div>                <p class="credits"><span class="label">Credit:</span> Cecil Beaton/Imperial War Museums</p>                    </li>

American youths fighting overseas, however, were not into "drab, sterile announcements" with middle-of-the-road music, Cronauer told The Associated Press in 1987. The battle over the airwaves was joined: "I wanted to serve the listeners."</p><p>His military radio antics inspired the character played by Robin Williams in the film "Good Morning, Vietnam," who drops Perry Como and Lawrence Welk from his 6 a.m. playlist in favor of the Dave Clark Five. Cronauer loved the movie but admitted much of it was Hollywood make-believe, explaining, "Yes, I did try to make it sound more like a stateside station. Yes, I did have problems with news censorship. Yes, I was in a restaurant shortly before the Viet Cong hit it. And yes, I did start each program by yelling, 'Good Morning, Vietnam!'"</p><p>The rest was invention on the part of Hollywood scriptwriters and Williams' improvisational genius. "If I did even half the things that Robin did in the movie, I'd still be in Leavenworth!" Cronauer told journalist Rick Fredericksen in 2014.</p><p>After the military, he worked in radio, television and advertising. He also attended the University of Pennsylvania's law school and worked in communications law. He later handled prisoner-of-war issues for the Pentagon. "I always was a bit of an iconoclast, as Robin was in the film," Cronauer told the AP in 1999. A lifelong, card-carrying Republican, he said he was not anti-military or anti-establishment: "I was anti-stupidity. And you certainly do run into a lot of stupidity in the military."&nbsp;</p></div>                <p class="credits"><span class="label">Credit:</span> Adrian Cronauer, courtesy of Paul Bottoms; Thanks to AFVNvets.net</p>                    </li>

The shy boy - abandoned by his father and raised by a domineering mother - joined the Coast Guard at 15 by lying about his age. An equestrian and figure skater, he emerged a star in the 1952 potboiler "Island of Desire." Soon after, the handsome, muscular Hunter appeared on a flood of magazine covers, nabbed a seven-year contract with Warner Brothers, and won the admiration of millions of teenage girls as the "Sigh Guy." He starred in the films "Battle Cry," "The Burning Hills" (opposite Natalie Wood), "They Came to Cordura" (with Gary Cooper), and "Damn Yankees!" He also topped the Billboard chart in 1957 with his recording of "Young Love"</p><p>Rumors about the actor's homosexuality burned up the scandal sheets, but he continued working under the studio-projected image of him as a teen heartthrob. "I was living a lie, absolutely," he told "Sunday Morning" in 2005. "I was another person. I mean, my sexuality was my sexuality. And it was not what people perceived. You know, people believe what they want to believe. But this was very difficult for me."</p><p>His career ebbed to a short-lived TV show and cheap exploitation flicks ("Ride the Wild Surf"), and small roles in "The Loved One," ''The Life and Times of Judge Roy Bean" and "Grease 2." But in the 1980s, he won new fans by appearing in cult movies with Divine, the 300-pound transvestite, most notably John Waters' 1981 "Polyester" and Paul Bartel's 1985 "Lust in the Dust."</p><p>In his 2005 memoir, "Tab Hunter Confidential: The Making of a Movie Star," Hunter recounted the stresses of being a love object to millions of young women when he was, in reality, a gay man. "I believed, wholeheartedly - still do - that a person's happiness depends on being true to themselves," he wrote. "The dilemma, of course, was that being true to myself - and I'm talking sexually now - was impossible in 1953."</p></div>                <p class="credits"><span class="label">Credit:</span> AP Photo</p>                    </li>

Diaz was freelancing for AP in November 1999 when a boater found a Cuban boy floating in an inner tube in the waters off Fort Lauderdale. Diaz spent the next few months chatting with Elian Gonzalez's relatives and neighbors, earning their trust by respecting an order from the boy's uncle to not speak to the child.</p><p>Because of those relationships, he was the only photographer to capture the moment when U.S. immigration agents ended a bitter international custody battle with a pre-dawn raid the day before Easter in 2000. Diaz's Pulitzer Prize-winning photo shows an armed U.S. immigration agent reaching out toward the terrified six-year-old, seconds before the boy was pulled out of his uncle's Little Havana home so he could be returned to his father in Cuba. &nbsp;</p><p>After the picture hit the wires and network news, Diaz saw how both Cuban leader Fidel Castro and Cuban-American community leaders used it to argue that the other side was brutal and heartless. "I have no opinion on it. I shot the moment. That's all," Diaz said last year. "Good or bad, that's what happened that morning."</p><p>During his career Diaz, who was known to roar, "Hello, Miami!" every time he entered the AP's South Florida office, shot World Series games, recovery efforts after 9/11, hurricanes, and, memorably, the magnified eye of an election official trying to make sense of a hanging chad during the disputed 2000 Florida recount.</p></div>                <p class="credits"><span class="label">Credit:</span> Alan Diaz, Wilfredo Lee/AP</p>                    </li>

He brought that pugnacious style to his work, penning nightmarish, sometimes darkly humorous stories. He wrote some 50 books and more than 1,400 articles, essays, TV scripts and screenplays, and earned nearly a dozen Nebula and Hugo awards.</p><p>He once said he wanted his stories "to grab you by the throat and tear off parts of your body."</p><p>Some of his most popular works were surrealistic fantasies set in grisly worlds run by totalitarians and conformists. "A Boy and His Dog," set in a world devastated by nuclear war, featured a protagonist who communicated with his dog via telepathy; he recently expanded the novella into a full-length novel, "Blood's A Rover." He edited the seminal 1967 sci-fi anthology "Dangerous Visions," and his short story, "I Have No Mouth &amp; I Must Scream," is about the last humans, eternally tortured by a malevolent, godlike computer. </p><p>His 1967 "Star Trek" episode, "The City on the Edge of Forever," is thought by many to be the best ever, in which a young woman played by Joan Collins is saved from a fatal accident by the starship Enterprise's time-traveling Dr. McCoy. Later, the ship's Capt. Kirk and Mr. Spock learn they must return to the year 1930 and let her die or history will be changed and Nazi Germany will win World War II.</p><p>"Harlan Ellison: There was no one quite like him in American letters, and never will be," author Stephen King Tweeted.

In January 1945, Turgel and her mother were forced onto a death march from Auschwitz to Buchenwald, and later on to Bergen-Belsen in Germany. It was in a hospital at Bergen-Belsen where the 22-year-old Turgel cared for 15-year-old Anne Frank as she lay dying from typhus. "I washed her face, gave her water to drink, and I can still see that face, her hair and how she looked," Turgel told the BBC. One month after Frank's death, the camp was liberated by the Allies.</p><p>After the war, Turgel married one of the death camp's liberators (a British Jew), earning the nickname "The Bride of Belsen." (Her wedding dress, made from parachute silk, is part of the collection of the Imperial War Museum in London.) In 1987 she published a memoir, "I Light a Candle," and until the end of her life she retold the story of the Holocaust and the horrors of anti-Semitism she witnessed. </p><p>In April she attended Britain's National Holocaust Remembrance Ceremony in London: "My story is the story of one survivor, but it is also the story of six million who perished. Maybe that's why I was spared - so my testimony would serve as a memorial, like that candle that I light, for the men, women and children who have no voice."</p></div>                <p class="credits"><span class="label">Credit:</span> Paul Faith/AP</p>                    </li>

Assigned to oversee the candidate's visit, Tuck &ndash; a WWII vet studying under the GI Bill (and who was actually working for Douglas) &ndash; hired a large hall and invited a smattering of people, leaving more than 1,900 empty seats. He then quizzed Nixon on the International Monetary Fund.</p><p>Though mild by some dirty tricksters' standards, Tuck's decades' long pranks of Nixon were humorous, such as hiring an old woman to console the candidate after his debate against John F. Kennedy with the reassuring, "That's all right, you'll do better next time," or having people in San Francisco's Chinatown hold up a sign in Chinese asking about a questionable loan billionaire Howard Hughes gave to Nixon's brother. Informed of the translation, Nixon ripped up the sign.</p><p>"I never tried to be malicious," Tuck told Time magazine in 1973 of his pranks, from altering the slips of paper inside fortune cookies to embarrass a candidate during a fundraiser, to directing garbage trucks to troll the GOP convention, to hiring pregnant women wearing T-shirts reading, "Nixon's the One." And the wit of his pranks found a reluctant admirer in Nixon himself, who was heard on the White House tapes comparing Tuck's work favorably to his own team's "dirty tricks."</p><p>"I've made a lot of candidates look foolish," Tuck was quoted as saying, "usually with a lot of help from the candidates themselves."&nbsp;</p></div>                <p class="credits"><span class="label">Credit:</span> AP</p>                    </li>

His work broke countless rules, but was grounded in old-school, shoe-leather reporting. "Nothing fuels the imagination more than real facts do," Wolfe told the AP in 1999. "As the saying goes, 'You can't make this stuff up.'"</p><p>His book "The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test" captured the '60s psychedelic culture and his travels with Ken Kesey and the Merry Pranksters.

First serialized in Rolling Stone, it was published in 1987 and became a critical and commercial blockbuster. Wolfe followed with more fiction, including "A Man in Full," "I Am Charlotte Simmons" and "Back to Blood."</p><p>In 1986 Wolfe suffered a massive heart attack and underwent a quintuple bypass, which both saved his life and changed it.

Bipolar, she suffered a paranoia-fueled breakdown in 1996 when a computer virus destroyed three years' worth of writing on her laptop that could not be salvaged. She was found after disappearing for four days in the hills of Los Angeles, received help, and would eventually resume acting (and writing). She appeared on the TV series "Smallville," "The L Word," and "La Femme Nikita," and won an Emmy Award for the children's TV series "R.L. Stine's The Haunting Hour." </p><p>She also became an outspoken activist; in 2011 she was arrested outside the White House protesting the Keystone pipeline.</p></div>                <p class="credits"><span class="label">Credit:</span> American International Pictures</p>                    </li>

I wasn't being harassed," she told The Globe and Mail in 2011. </p><p>First published in Cosmopolitan magazine, the picture would become the most famous taken by Orkin (who died in 1985). Ninalee, meanwhile, would become an advertising copywriter, and marry twice - first to a widowed Venetian count, Achille Passi, and later a Canadian steel executive, Robert Craig. In what was a coincidence for the ages, the man pictured on the motor scooter ogling Ninalee turned out to be a cousin of her first husband, and a business partner of her second.</p></div>                <p class="credits"><span class="label">Credit:</span> Copyright 1952, 1980 Ruth Orkin; Courtesy of Ruth Orkin Photo Archive</p>                    </li>

But no screenplay could ever have matched the bizarre turn that her life took when, in 1976, she was kidnapped by agents of North Korean dictator Kim Jong Il; her husband, film director Shin Sang-ok, was also abducted and held in a North Korean prison for four years, before the two were reunited and tasked by Kim to make films for his regime. (In addition to being a dictator, Kim was also a movie fan, and was often credited as executive producer on films made in Pyongyang.)</p><p>Feigning loyalty, Choi and Shin produced nearly two dozen films for Kim, which was good enough to keep them alive, and ultimately to earn them a trip to Austria to attend a film festival in 1986. There, they managed to slip away from their minders and head for the U.S. embassy in Vienna, and freedom. They resettled in America for a time, but work in Hollywood was difficult to come by, and they returned to South Korea, their bizarre odyssey told in the 2016 documentary, "The Lovers and the Despot." As Choi remarked, "There's acting for film, and there's acting for life. And in North Korea, those could be one and the same thing."</p></div>                <p class="credits"><span class="label">Credit:</span> Magnolia Pictures</p>                    </li>

But he recorded an audition tape for the brutal drill instructor and won the part, for which he received a Golden Globe nomination.

Ermey also hosted the History Channel series "Mail Call" (in which he answered viewer questions about military life) and "Lock N' Load with R. Lee Ermey."</p><p>"I generally do play authoritative roles," Ermey told the website <a href="../../../www.cinemablend.com/about.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CinemaBlend</a> in 2007. "I'm not competition to Pee Wee Herman by any stretch of the imagination. &hellip; I do occasionally play sentimental or gentle or emotional characters. It's no problem. It just depends what the script calls for. I played a gay homicidal high school football coach in 'Saving Silverman.' When they offered that to me, I thought, 'Oh boy, that's a stretch. That's a challenge.' But it worked out okay."</p></div>                <p class="credits"><span class="label">Credit:</span> Warner Brothers</p>                    </li>

Shore arrived just when a huge stand-up boom was erupting, in no better a place than L.A., after Johnny Carson relocated "The Tonight Show" to the West Coast. Shore became a queen of the comedy scene, with arguably more power than anyone to make or break the career of an up-and-coming comedian.</p><p>Shore essentially lived at the club through the 1970s and '80s [her four children, including comic Pauly Shore, roamed the floor since they were small], and she gave comics gigs, advice, guidance, a clubhouse in which to hang out and talk shop, and occasionally a stairwell in which to sleep. </p><p>Virtually every major comic, from Richard Pryor, Robin Williams, Richard Lewis and Jim Carrey to Jerry Seinfeld and Kathy Griffin, used the club (referred to as "a boxing gym for comedy") as a stepping-stone. Many returned to hone their acts after they gained fame.

The stores' circus-like atmosphere - aimed at making kids want to keep coming back - was amplified by its mascot, Geoffrey the giraffe, who appeared in his first TV commercial in 1973. By the 1980s and early '90s, Toys R Us dominated the retail toy industry.</p><p>In an interview with videographer Mark Aaron, posted to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=13&amp;v=JG2W0F_rdvA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Youtube</a>, Lazarus described the toy industry as a happy business. "You've gotta be kind of kid-like," he said. "When you look at what the creativity of the toy market is, you have to have imagination. You have to think like a child."</p><p>Lazarus stepped down as CEO of Toys R Us in 1994.

Hawking was diagnosed with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), or Lou Gehrig's disease, when he was a student at Cambridge; doctors believed it would kill him in his early 20s. But despite his condition - confined to a wheelchair, and in later years speaking via a voice synthesizer - he was able to pursue his studies of quantum mechanics, gravity, black holes, and a Unified Theory of Cosmology.</p><p>As slowly as a word per minute, Hawking used the twitching of the muscle under his right eye to grind out his thoughts on a custom-built computer. What he produced was a masterwork of popular science, a guidebook through the esoteric world of anti-particles, quarks, and quantum theory. </p><p>Hawking's other major scientific contribution was to cosmology, the study of the universe's origin and evolution. Working with Jim Hartle of UC, Santa Barbara, Hawking proposed in 1983 that space and time might have no beginning and no end. "Asking what happens before the Big Bang is like asking for a point one mile north of the North Pole," he said.</p><p>Hawking appeared in several documentaries, and played himself (or at least a holographic version of Stephen Hawking) in a 1993 episode of "Star Trek: The Next Generation." His life was dramatized in the 2014 film "The Theory of Everything," starring Eddie Redmayne.&nbsp;</p></div>                <p class="credits"><span class="label">Credit:</span> Getty Images</p>                    </li>

"That's the kind of stock I'm from and that's where I think the strength of the country is. You go into a college football town, and you will find three generations of a family sitting together. It's a rallying point for the university, the community and the families."</p></div>                <p class="credits"><span class="label">Credit:</span> AP</p>                    </li>

After walking the lunar surface, he commanded the maiden voyage of the space shuttle, and oversaw 25 shuttle flights during the program's formative years.</p><p>A relentless advocate for improving flight safety, Young was occasionally a thorn in the side of NASA management, especially in the wake of the 1986 Challenger disaster. Throughout it all, he brought a dry wit, a ready smile, and a cool nerve that belied a near-photographic memory and encyclopedic knowledge of complex space systems.</p><p>Before blasting off aboard the shuttle Columbia on the first flight of the winged orbiter - the first time anyone had launched aboard the untried booster rockets - Young was asked if he had any worries. "Anyone who sits on top of the largest hydrogen-oxygen fueled system in the world, knowing they're going to light the bottom, and doesn't get a little worried, does not fully understand the situation," he famously deadpanned.</p><p>"My life has been long, and it has been interesting. It's also been a lot of fun, and a lot of hard, challenging work," Young once stated. "If I could do it over, I would do it over the very same way. Most of it has been a marvel to me."</p></div>                <p class="credits"><span class="label">Credit:</span> NASA</p>                    </li>

"I came away thinking, 'TV is a piece of cake; I want more of this!'" he later told the Associated Press.</p><p>Van Dyke would make regular appearances on variety showcases like "The Judy Garland Show" and "The Ed Sullivan Show," and starred in one of the most high-concept situation comedies ever: "My Mother the Car," in which his character's deceased mother is reincarnated as a 1928 Porter automobile. He remarked in 1990 that his brother told him the show sounded promising - this at a time when a show featuring a talking horse was a hit. "I never asked him for advice after that," Jerry added.</p><p>With scores of TV and movie appearances (including "That Girl," "Gomer Pyle: USMC," "The Mary Tyler Moore Show," "Love, American Style," "The Love Boat," "Fantasy Island," and "Fresno"), Van Dyke scored his greatest success with the long-running ABC comedy "Coach," playing assistant coach Luther Van Dam opposite series star Craig T. Nelson. The role would earn Van Dyke four Emmy Award nominations.&nbsp;</p></div>                <p class="credits"><span class="label">Credit:</span> CBS</p>                    </li>

This repository contains the code for the research project. All code is found in *src* and *test*. All HTML files used in JUnit tests is located in *testset*. All HTML files that are used for the data set are located in *dataset*. Any additional data needed for the code, such as the HTML color names and RGB codes are located in the *data* folder.

The primary technical documentation for the project is located in *NRummel_PTD.pptx*. Detailed progress can be seen from commit comments and issues.

All code was compiled under Java 8 Update 171. All tests were written with JUnit 4. The code also uses [JSoup 1.11.3](https://jsoup.org/) as an HTML parser and DOM tree builder for the visual feature detection.
